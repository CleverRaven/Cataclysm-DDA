When you take damage from almost any source, you'll start to feel pain. Pain\n\
slows you down and reduces your stats, and finding a way to manage pain is an\n\
early imperative. The most common is drugs; aspirin, codeine, tramadol,\n\
oxycodone, and more are all great options. Be aware that while under the\n\
influence of a lot of painkillers, the physiological effects may slow you or\n\
reduce your stats.\n\

Note that most painkillers take a little while to kick in. If you take some\n\
oxycodone, and don't notice the effects right away, don't start taking more;\n\

Pain will also disappear with time, so if drugs aren't available and you're\n\
in a lot of pain, it may be wise to find a safe spot and simply rest for an\n\
extended period of time.\n\

Another common class of drugs is stimulants. Stimulants provide you with a\n\
temporary rush of energy, increasing your movement speed and many stats, most\n\
notably intelligence, making them useful study aids. There are two drawbacks\n\
to stimulants; they make it more difficult to sleep, and, more importantly,\n\

Your character has a morale level, which affects you in many ways. The\n\
depressing post-apocalypse world is tough to deal with, and your mood will\n\
naturally decrease very slowly.\n\

There are lots of options for increasing morale; reading an entertaining\n\

\n\
There are also lots of ways for your morale to decrease, beyond its natural\n\
decay. Eating disgusting food, reading a boring technical book, or going\n\

Low morale will make you sluggish and unmotivated. It will also reduce your\n\

Morale is also responsible for ensuring you can learn effectively, via a\n\
mechanic referred to as 'focus'. Your focus level is a measure of how\n\
effectively you can learn. The natural level is 100, which indicates normal\n\
learning potential. Higher or lower focus levels make it easier or harder\n\
to learn from practical experience.\n\
\n\
Your focus level has a natural set point that it converges towards. When your\n\
focus is much lower - or higher - than this set point, it will change faster\n\
than when it is near the set point. Having high morale will raise the set\n\
point, and having low morale will lower the set point. Pain is also factored\n\
into the set point calculation - it's harder to learn when you're in pain.\n\
\n\
Your focus is also lowered by certain activities. Training your skills\n\
through real-world practice lowers your focus gradually, by an amount that\n\
depends on your current level of focus (higher focus means larger decreases,\n\
as well as improved learning). Training your skills by reading books\n\
decreases your focus rapidly, by giving a significant penalty to the set\n\
point of your focus."));

The first thing to do is to check your home for useful items. Your initial\n\
storage is limited, and a backpack, trenchcoat, or other storage medium will\n\
let you carry a lot more. Finding a weapon is important; frying pans, butcher\n\
knives, and more are common in your home; hardware stores may carry others.\n\
Unless you plan on concentrating on melee combat, seek out gun stores as soon\n\
as possible and load up on more than one type.\n\
\n\
It's also important to carry a few medications; painkillers are a must-have,\n\
and drugs such as cigarettes will make life easier (but beware addiction).\n\
Leave cities as soon as you have a good stockpile of equipment. Their high\n\
concentration of zombies makes them a deathtrap--but a necessary resource\n\
for food and ammunition.\n\
\n\
Combat is much easier if you can fight just one monster at once. Use doorways\n\
as a choke point, or stand behind a window and strike as the zombies slowly\n\
climb through. Never be afraid to just run if you can outpace your enemies.\n\
Irregular terrain, like forests, may help you lose monsters.\n\
\n\
Firearms are the easiest way to kill an enemy, but the sound will attract\n\
unwanted attention. Save the guns for emergencies, and melee when you can.\n\

Q: What is Safe Mode, and why does it prevent me from moving?\n\
A: Safe Mode is a way to guarantee that you won't die by holding a movement\n\

A: Lots of the food found in towns is perishable, and will only last a few\n\

   and remove your clothing to swim, making it a last-ditch escape plan.\n\

Q: Shotguns bring in more zombies than they kill!  What's the point?\n\
A: Shotguns are intended for emergency use. If you are cornered, use\n\
   your shotgun to escape, then just run from the zombies it attracts.\n\
\n\
Q: Help! I started a fire and now my house is burning down!\n\
A: Fires will spread to nearby flammable tiles if they are able. Lighting a\n\
   stop fire in a set-up brazier, wood stove, stone fireplace, or pit will\n\
   it from spreading. Fire extinguishers can put out fires that get out\n\
   of control.\n\
\n\
Q: I have a question that's not addressed here. How can I get an answer?\n\
A: Ask the helpful people on the forum at smf.cataclysmdda.com or email\n\
   your question to TheDarklingWolf@Gmail.com."));
