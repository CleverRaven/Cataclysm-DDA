# I (acidia) just made this as a quick utility to change a character map in drawing.txt
#into a json that the game can process.  You'll have to modify the paths in this
#folder unless you decide to put all the files in 'c:\building utility' and create
#a folder called 'output' for it to drop the finished result in.  This is in no
#way polished, it just saved me a huge amount of time creating 9x9 buildings so
#I figured someone else might be able to use it.
