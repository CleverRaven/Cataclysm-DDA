# We have branch builds disabled globally to prevent double-builds of PRs.
# This re-enables just the master branch.
# Overall strategy for what sorts of builds to include:
# We want a build for each compiler and each platform.
# For PRs, we lessen the "each compiler" requirement to just covering the newest
# and oldest relevant version of each compiler.
# We also want to ensure that each of the following tweaks are covered in at
# least one PR build:
# - TILES=1
# - SOUND=1
# - RELEASE=1
# - CMAKE=1
# - SANITIZE=address
# - LOCALIZE=0
# - A clang-tidy run (now switched to GitHub workflow)
# - Tests with important mods enabled (Magiclysm, RL_Classes)
# We try to minimize the number of builds subject to those constraints.
