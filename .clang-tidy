# Enable some categories of checks and then disable individual ones.
# The disabled checks that appear as part of the initial alphabetical section
# enabling categories (e.g. cert-err58-cpp) are ones that do not make sense for
# this codebase and we do not intend to fix.  The disabled checks appearing
# thereafter in a separate alphabetical list have yet to be triaged.  We may
# fix their errors or recategorise them as checks we don't care about.
#
# Comments on the checks we have decided are not worthwhile:
#
# * cert-dcl21-cpp (postfix operator++ and operator-- should return const objects)
# This is an unconventional code style, and conflicts with
# readability-const-return-type.
#
# * cert-env33-c (calls to system, popen)
# Unlikely to catch bugs, and using system is convenient for portability.
#
# * cert-err58-cpp (exceptions from static variable declarations)
# We have lots of memory allocations in static variable declarations, and
# that's fine.
#
# * modernize-use-auto
# We prefer an almost-always-avoid-auto style.
#
# * modernize-use-trailing-return-type
# An arbitrary style convention we haven't adopted.
#
# * readability-braces-around-statements
# Covered by astyle and buggy in clang-tidy 8.  Can enable once we have a newer
# clang-tidy.
