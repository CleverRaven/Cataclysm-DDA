// When a "recipe" or "uncraft" has a "difficulty" and "skill_used", recovery of components when
// disassembling from that recipe/uncraft may fail, depending on the skill level of the character
// doing disassembly.
//
// For each of the recipe or uncraft "components", two dice rolls are made:
//
//           Difficulty roll:  #dice = difficulty  #sides = 24
//      Character skill roll:  #dice = 4*SKILL+2   #sides = INT+16
//
// For example, if recipe difficulty is 1, character skill is 0, and INT is the normal 8, the
// character is at an advantage in the dice rolls:
//
//           Difficulty roll:  1 d 24  (difficulty# dice, 24 sides)
//      Character skill roll:  2 d 24  (4*0+2 dice, 8+16 sides)
//
// For a more difficult recipe, say difficulty 4, with character still having 0 skill, and 8 INT,
// they are at a disadvantage:
//
//           Difficulty roll:  4 d 24  (difficulty# dice, 24 sides)
//      Character skill roll:  2 d 24  (4*0+2 dice, 8+16 sides)
//
// The character can increase their dice by increasing skill level; each level gives 4 additional
// dice to the character, so if they can increase their skill to 1, then attempt the same recipe,
// they will be at a slight advantage again:
//
//           Difficulty roll:  4 d 24  (difficulty# dice, 24 sides)
//      Character skill roll:  6 d 24  (4*1+2 dice, 8+16 sides)
//
// For each component, if the character skill roll *exceeds* the difficulty roll, recovery succeeds.
// Recipes with 0 difficulty do not require any skill to succeed; all components are recovered.
//
// Recovery may still fail if the original item was damaged; for that, see the [damage] test.
