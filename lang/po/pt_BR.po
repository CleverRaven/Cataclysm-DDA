"Handguns are small weapons held in one or both hands.  They are much more difficult to aim and control than larger firearms, and this is reflected in their poor accuracy.  However, their small size makes them appropriate for short-range combat.  They are also relatively quick to reload and use a very wide selection of ammunition.  Their small size and low weight make it possible to carry several loaded handguns, switching from one to the next once their ammo is spent."

"<color_green>( Crossbows</color>\n"
"The best feature of crossbows is their silence. The bolts they fire are only rarely destroyed; if you pick up the bolts after firing them, your ammunition supply will last much longer. Crossbows suffer from a short range and a very long reload time (modified by your strength); plus, most only hold a single round. \n"
"For this reason, it is advisable to carry a few loaded crossbows. Crossbows can be very difficult to find; however, it is possible to craft one given enough Mechanics skill. Likewise, it is possible to make wooden bolts from any number of wooden objects, though these are much less effective than steel bolts. Crossbows use the handgun skill."

"<color_yellow>( Bows</color>\n"
"Silent, deadly, easy to make, and the arrows are reusable. Bows have been used forever. Bows are two handed and require the user to have a certain strength level. If you do not have enough strength to draw the string back, you will fire at a reduced effectiveness. This reduces the reload and fire speeds and decreases the range of the arrows fired. \n"
"Most normal bows require strength of at least 8, others require an above average strength of 10, or a significant strength of 12. Bows use the archery skill."

"Shotguns are some of the most powerful weapons in the game, capable of taking out almost any enemy with a single hit. Birdshot and 00 shot spread, making it very easy to hit nearby monsters.  However, they are very ineffective against armor, and some armored monsters might shrug off 00 shot completely.  Shotgun slugs are the answer to this problem; they also offer much better range than shot.\n"
"The biggest drawback to shotguns is their noisiness.  They are very loud, and impossible to silence. A shot that kills one zombie might attract three more!  Beware of that."

"Submachine guns are small weapons (some are barely larger than a handgun), designed for relatively close combat and the ability to spray large amounts of bullets. However, they are more effective when firing single shots, so use discretion. They mainly use the 9mm and .45 ammunition; however, other SMGs exist.

Unlike assault rifles, sniper and marksman rifles usually have no automatic fire.  They are also may be slow to reload and fire, so when facing a large group of nearby enemies, they are not the best pick."

"Energy weapons have no recoil at all; they are nearly silent, have a long range, and are fairly damaging. The biggest drawback to energy weapons is scarcity of ammunition; it is wise to reserve the precious ammo for when you really need it."

"Q: What is Safe Mode, and why does it prevent me from moving?\n"
"A: Safe Mode is a way to guarantee that you won't die by holding a movement key down. When a monster comes into view, your movement will be ignored until Safe Mode is turned off with the ! key. This ensures that the sudden appearance of a monster won't catch you off guard."

"Q: It seems like everything I eat makes me sick! What's wrong?\n"
"A: Lots of the food found in towns is perishable and will only last a few days after the start of a new game. The electricity went out several days ago so fruit, milk and others are the first to go bad. After the first couple of days, you should switch to canned food, jerky, and hunting. Also, you should make sure to cook any food and purify any water you hunt up as it may contain parasites or otherwise be unsafe."

"Q: Why do I always sink when I try to swim?\n"
"A: Your swimming ability is reduced greatly by the weight you are carrying, and is also adversely affected by the clothing you wear. Until you reach a high level of the swimming skill, you'll need to drop your equipment and remove your clothing to swim, making it a last-ditch escape plan."
