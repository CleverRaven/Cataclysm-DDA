"Q: What is Safe Mode, and why does it prevent me from moving?\n"
"A: Safe Mode is a way to guarantee that you won't die by holding a movement\n"
"   key down. When a monster comes into view, your movement will be ignored\n"
"   until Safe Mode is turned off with the ! key. This ensures that\n"

"Q: It seems like everything I eat makes me sick! What's wrong?\n"
"A: Lots of the food found in towns is perishable, and will only last a few\n"
"   days after the start of a new game (July 12). Fruit, milk, and others\n"
