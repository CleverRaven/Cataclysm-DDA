"      The EPA has opposed the Security-Restricted Containment\n"

"  allowed to freely examine and monitor the sarcophagi.  But that\n"

"  unidentified compounds in the ground water.  We now have\n"
"  conclusive evidence that the SRCFs are a threat to the public\n"
"  safety.  We are taking these data to state representatives and\n"
