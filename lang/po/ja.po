"Q: What is Safe Mode, and why does it prevent me from moving?\n"
"A: Safe Mode is a way to guarantee that you won't die by holding a movement\n"
"   key down. When a monster comes into view, your movement will be ignored\n"
"   until Safe Mode is turned off with the ! key. This ensures that\n"
"   the sudden appearence of a monster won't catch you off guard.\n"
"\n"
"Q: It seems like everything I eat makes me sick! What's wrong?\n"
"A: Lots of the food found in towns is perishable, and will only last a few\n"
"   days after the start of a new game (July 12). Fruit, milk, and others\n"
"   are the first to go. After the first couple of days, you should switch\n"

"A: You have the Schizophrenic trait, which might make the game seem buggy.\n"

"Q: How can I prevent monsters from attacking while I sleep?\n"

"\n"
"Q: Shotguns bring in more zombies than they kill!  What's the point?\n"
"A: Shotguns are intended for emergency use. If you are cornered, use\n"

"Q: Why do I always sink when I try to swim?\n"
"A: Your swimming ability is reduced greatly by the weight you are carrying,\n"

"A: At present time, there is only one cure, royal jelly. You can find royal\n"

"\n"
"Q: How do I get into science labs?\n"
"A: You can enter the front door if you have an ID card by %s the\n"
"   keypad. If you are skilled in computers and have an electrohack, it is\n"
"   possible to hack the keypad. An EMP blast has a chance to force the "
