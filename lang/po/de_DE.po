"Q: What is Safe Mode, and why does it prevent me from moving?\n"
"A: Safe Mode is a way to guarantee that you won't die by holding a movement\n"
"   key down. When a monster comes into view, your movement will be ignored\n"
"   until Safe Mode is turned off with the ! key. This ensures that\n"
"   the sudden appearence of a monster won't catch you off guard.\n"
"\n"
"Q: It seems like everything I eat makes me sick! What's wrong?\n"
"A: Lots of the food found in towns is perishable, and will only last a few\n"
"   days after the start of a new game (July 12). Fruit, milk, and others\n"
"   are the first to go. After the first couple of days, you should switch\n"
"   to canned food, jerky, and hunting.\n"
"\n"
"Q: How can I remove boards from boarded-up windows and doors?\n"
"A: Use a hammer and choose the direction of the boarded-up window or\n"
"   door to remove the boards.\n"
"\n"
"Q: The game just told me to quit, and other weird stuff is happening.\n"
"A: You have the Schizophrenic trait, which might make the game seem buggy.\n"
"\n"
"Q: How can I prevent monsters from attacking while I sleep?\n"
"A: Find a safe place to sleep, in a building far from the front door.\n"
"   Set traps if you have them, or build a fire."

"Q: Why can't I carry anything?\n"
"A: At the start of the game you only have the space in your pockets.\n"
"   A good first goal of many survivors is to find a backpack or pouch to\n"
"   store things in. (The shelter basement is a good place to check first!)\n"
"\n"
"Q: Shotguns bring in more zombies than they kill!  What's the point?\n"
"A: Shotguns are intended for emergency use. If you are cornered, use\n"
"   your shotgun to escape, then just run from the zombies it attracts.\n"
"\n"
"Q: Help! I started a fire and now my house is burning down!\n"
"A: Fires will spread to nearby flammable tiles if they are able. Lighting a\n"
"   stop fire in a set-up brazier, wood stove, stone fireplace, or pit will\n"
"   it from spreading. Fire extinguishers can put out fires that get out\n"
"   of control.\n"

"Q: I have a question that's not addressed here. How can I get an answer?\n"

"Q: Why do I always sink when I try to swim?\n"
"A: Your swimming ability is reduced greatly by the weight you are carrying,\n"
"   and is also adversely affected by the clothing you wear. Until you reach\n"
"   a high level in the swimming skill, you'll need to drop your equipment \n"
"   and remove your clothing to swim, making it a last-ditch escape plan.\n"
"\n"
"Q: How can I cure a fungal infection?\n"
"A: At present time, there is only one cure, royal jelly. You can find royal\n"
"   jelly in the bee hives which dot forests.\n"
"\n"
"Q: How do I get into science labs?\n"
"A: You can enter the front door if you have an ID card by %s the\n"
"   keypad. If you are skilled in computers and have an electrohack, it is\n"
"   possible to hack the keypad. An EMP blast has a chance to force the "
"doors\n"
"   open, but it's more likely to break them. You can also sneak in through\n"
"   the sewers sometimes, or try to smash through the walls with explosions.\n"
"\n"
"Q: Why does my crafting fail so often?\n"
"A: Check the difficulty of the recipe, and the primary skill used; your\n"
"   skill level should be around one and a half times the difficulty to\n"
"   be confident that it will succeed."
