"Handguns are small weapons held in one or both hands. They are much more "
"difficult to aim and control than larger firearms, and this is reflected in "
"their poor accuracy. However, their small size makes them appropriate for "
"short-range combat, where larger guns fare poorly. They are also relatively "
"quick to reload and use a very wide selection of ammunition. Their small "
"size and low weight make it possible to carry several loaded handguns, "

"The best feature of crossbows is their silence. The bolts they fire are only "
"rarely destroyed; if you pick up the bolts after firing them, your "

"For this reason, it is advisable to carry a few loaded crossbows. Crossbows "
"can be very difficult to find; however, it is possible to craft one given "
