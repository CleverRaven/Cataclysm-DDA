Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead
==========================
You emerge from the shelter into the dim light of an overcast day, and look around for the first time since the disaster.

The world as you knew it is gone. A ruined world stands in its place, full of nightmares come to life. Nothing can ever go back to the way it was, before the Cataclysm, but you have to be strong. You have to survive. You have to persevere. If you don't, death will be one of the better outcomes.

Above your head, storm clouds gather, and the rain stings and hisses against your skin. You shoulder your backpack, and start walking. The world has gone to hell, but you get the sinking feeling that there are darker days ahead.

Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a roguelike set in a post-apocalyptic world. While some have described it as a "zombie game", there's far more to Cataclysm than that. Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistant, procedurally generated world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization for for food, equipment, or, if you're lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of gas to get you the hell out of Dodge. Fight to defeat or escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities, from zombies to giant insects to killer robots and things far stranger and deadlier, and against the others like yourself, that want what you have...

Build the tools and defenses you will need to overcome the challenges you face, from a strongly fortified lair full of customized firearms and surrounded by pits and landmines, to a mobile, gasoline powered blade spinning fortress of death, tearing apart anything stupid enough to get in the way. And finally, improve! Learn skills to help you survive, acquire mind-bending mutations, and convert your own body into a cybernetic masterpiece.

Make no mistake - there is no other game quite like Cataclysm. How long can you survive?
