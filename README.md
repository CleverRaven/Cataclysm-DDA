# Cataclysm: Restored

Cataclysm: Restored is a fan fork of Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead, a turn-based survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world.  The purpose of this fork is to remove more recent changes to the game a portion of the fanbase does not like, and restore old features that were removed.  This build will not be for everyone, nor is it intended to.  It is likely to have bugs and half-implemented changes, as I (Command Line Vulpine) am only an amateur at modding.  I'm also tackling this as a solo dev, for now.


## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Why is this necessary?

A growing set of the fanbase has been dissatisfied with the direction the devs have been taking the base game; starting from around 0.E Stable onward.  Most recently, with 0.H Stable and experimentals beyond that are starting to aggravate a much larger portion of the fanbase.  The direction of the game has become very confused, with an over-focus on "realism" at the sacrifice of fun.

#### Why this instead of Bright Nights?

I've heard and found Bright Nights adjustments to be somewhat inconsistent, as well as being outdated.  For instance, I've heard it doesn't have the new inventory system added in 0.F - we're to 0.H now.  There are some features that have been added I think should stay, such as that inventory system.

#### Why you?

I'm no professional developer, but I'm not new to making mods.  Back in the 0.C era I made the Five Nights at Freddy's mod that added the animatronics and pizzeria to the game.  I also made the Lightfire Union mod for Stellaris which added a full fox furry race to the game using (with permission) artwork by real artists.  I've also done minor modifications for myself to CDDA when I play it.  Lastly, I've been playing CDDA since pre-0.A, all on camera for YouTube - I'll be blunt, and just say I think I have a better understanding of how the game was really meant to feel than the modern dev team.

#### What do you plan to change?

1. I'm removing portal storms.  In my opinion Cataclysm IS a zombie game, not an eldritch horror game.  I'm not removing eldritch creatures from their normal ways of spawning, because demons have been around from the start - and I feel another major aspect was an idea that many apocalypses are happening all at once; whereas now they want it to be just one.

2. No max item length for backpacks.  This was one of the big mistakes with the new inventory system.  Not being able to pick up a plank without wielding or dragging it is extremely frustrating.  Or being able to carry a crowbar or gun in it.  It only adds tedium, and the realism is questionable anyway; you could always leave a bag partially unzipped irl.

3. Removing breathability.  Its hard to remove core features, so my method of fixing this for now will be to make everything 100% breathable.  Sweating nearly killed a character of mine just boiling water.  Its completely unrealistic a person wouldn't realize they're too hot and back away from a fire automatically.  Additionally, it's redundant with Warmth anyway.  Just make armor hotter.

4. Acid rain.  The man, the myth, the legend.  Part of my feeling of "every apocalypse is happening at once" acid rain was core to the experience of Early CDDA.  I heard a rumor it was supposed to be put back in, but that was years ago now so it's clear it's not.  I'll do it myself.

5. Bringing back rags.  The tailoring system has been vastly over-complicated.  I would like to bring back rags being the only nessacary cloth resource.

6. Item re-rebalancing.  The all time classic starting weapon in CDDA was the makeshift crowbar.  Its time it made a comeback - a long with a lot of other fan favorite weapons.  (I'll try to keep it reasonable)

7. You tell me.  I haven't been completely tuned in to every single thing that's changed, some of it might be far beyond my power to fix.   But if it's a number in a json, I can do it.  Until I think of something better, just leave a comment on this youtube video of mine https://youtu.be/_lVssFyB0F4 and I'll look into it.
