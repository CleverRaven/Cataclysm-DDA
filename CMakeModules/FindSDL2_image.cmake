# FindSDL2_image
# -------------
#
# Locate SDL2_image library
#
# This module defines:
#
# ::
#
#   SDL2_IMAGE_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link against
#   SDL2_IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
#   SDL2_IMAGE_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
#   SDL2_IMAGE_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing the
#                              version of SDL2_image
#
#
#
# For backward compatiblity the following variables are also set:
#
# ::
#
#   SDL2IMAGE_LIBRARY (same value as SDL2_IMAGE_LIBRARIES)
#   SDL2IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL2_IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS)
#   SDL2IMAGE_FOUND (same value as SDL2_IMAGE_FOUND)
#
#
#
# $SDL2DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
# ./configure --prefix=$SDL2DIR used in building SDL2.
#
# Created by Eric Wing.  This was influenced by the FindSDL2.cmake
# module, but with modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
# additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
