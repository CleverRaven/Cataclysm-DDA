# ----------
#
# Find the curses include file and library
#
#
#
# ::
#
#   CURSES_FOUND - system has Curses
#   CURSES_INCLUDE_DIR - the Curses include directory
#   CURSES_LIBRARIES - The libraries needed to use Curses
#   CURSES_HAVE_CURSES_H - true if curses.h is available
#   CURSES_HAVE_NCURSES_H - true if ncurses.h is available
#   CURSES_HAVE_NCURSES_NCURSES_H - true if ncurses/ncurses.h is available
#   CURSES_HAVE_NCURSES_CURSES_H - true if ncurses/curses.h is available
#   CURSES_LIBRARY - set for backwards compatibility with 2.4 CMake
#
#
#
# Set CURSES_NEED_NCURSES to TRUE before the find_package() command if
# NCurses functionality is required.

# Not sure the logic is correct here.
# If NCurses is required, use the function wsyncup() to check if the library
# has NCurses functionality (at least this is where it breaks on NetBSD).
# If wsyncup is in curses, use this one.
# If not, try to find ncurses and check if this has the symbol.
# Once the ncurses library is found, search the ncurses.h header first, but
# some web pages also say that even with ncurses there is not always a ncurses.h:
# http://osdir.com/ml/gnome.apps.mc.devel/2002-06/msg00029.html
# So at first try ncurses.h, if not found, try to find curses.h under the same
# prefix as the library was found, if still not found, try curses.h with the
# default search paths.
