/* TOOLS
 * MAX is the maximum number of charges help.
 * DEF is the default number of charges--items will be generated with this
 *  many charges.
 * USE is how many charges are used up when 'a'pplying the object.
 * SEC is how many turns will pass before a charge is drained if the item is
 *  active; generally only used in the "<whatever> (on)" forms
 * FUEL is the type of charge the tool uses; set to AT_NULL if the item is
 *  unable to be recharged.
 * REVERT is the item type that the tool will revert to once its charges are
 *  drained
 * FUNCTION is a function called when the tool is 'a'pplied, or called once per
