## Cataclysm Steam Release FAQ

This FAQ is from the perspective of the existing players of the game and will not address questions about what will or won't be in the steam release, what it will cost, etc. Please go to the steam release page for that kind of information.

### Will the existence of a paid release affect the free and open-source nature of the game?

No. The game will always be free and open-source, and if you continue to get it through this website and github, you won't notice any difference at all. There could be features unique to the Steam API that are understandably Steam exclusive, but there is not and will never be any plan to have special "premium" features. Remember, there is already a paid iOS release, and it hasn't affected the game.

### Is this allowed in the license?

Yes. The CDDA license allows and even, some would say, encourages private sale. All contributors agree to this license when they add anything to the game. As mentioned above, it has been used in this way for many years already.

### Is this okay with the development team?

Yes. The core development team has been discussing the idea of a Steam release for a long time. We consider it inevitable that someone was going to make one, and are happy that it's someone with a great deal of investment and experience with the game. It's impossible to get everyone's opinions in such a large project, but those of us in the secret, shadowy cabal where we cackle madly at ways to cut the fun out of the game are all very happy to see KorGgenT heading this. Specifically, Kevin and Erk as the other two "senior developers" (whatever that means) were consulted in detail before any steps were made. (When asked if he had a problem with it, ZhilkinSerg just replied "no". We shook him gently, hoping for a more detailed answer, and he said "signs are hazy, ask again later".)

### Who gets the money? How will it be used?

Presently the money goes to KorGgenT, one of our most involved developers, in the hopes that he can find making DDA development a full time job, and to fund the programming and maintenance of features both for steam and for the rest of the game. In the unlikely but exciting event there's more money than Korg knows what to do with, we have a few ideas, but this is pretty unlikely. Any effort to split up the money would face a few problems: first, nobody wants the responsibility and hassle of managing money; second, there will not (I guarantee this) be enough money to make bounties or a similar cash-splitting tool into anything useful, and in order to set those up, someone would have to volunteer for all that extra cash management without any benefit. Nobody will do that, ever. We're here to play games and program, not be accountants.

### I am not okay with this.

That's fine. Download the free version or play a different game. Nobody is taking anything away from you, this is going to remain exactly as it was. You're no more forced to buy the Steam version than you were the iOS one.

### How do I deal with two zombies at once? They keep thrashing me and I don't know how to survive the first day.

Remember, melee is a choice of desperation and necessity against a purely melee enemy. Try to use terrain to your advantage so that you're only facing one zombie at a time. Wait, how did we get on this topic? You sly dog, you got me distracted.
