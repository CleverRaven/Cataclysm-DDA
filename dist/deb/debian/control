Description: Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead, a text-based zombie survival game.
 Cataclysm is a grim game set in a grim world where for all intents and purposes
 hell has assaulted earth and established a beachhead with intent to occupy.
 You stand alone, afraid, likely alive by coincidence alone, in a situation which
 imminently threatens not only your personal survival but the survival of humanity
 and our earth as we know it. Beset on all sides by shambling, shrieking,
 pus-dripping horrors straight out of the nightmares of Humanity's collective
 unconscious, you make your way through this desolation that used to be a world.
 .
 This is the console version, for tiles, use cataclysm-dda-tiles instead.
