Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a roguelike set in a post-apocalyptic world. While some have described
it as a "zombie game", there's far more to Cataclysm than that. Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistent,
procedurally generated world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization for for food, equipment,
or, if you're lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of gas to get you the hell out of Dodge. Fight to defeat
or escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities, from zombies to giant insects to killer robots
and things far stranger and deadlier, and against the others like yourself, that want what you have...
