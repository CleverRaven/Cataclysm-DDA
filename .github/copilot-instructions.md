# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Code Assistance & Licensing Policy

- Always help users understand license implications of code they're incorporating.
- For significant logic or non-standard patterns, include comments identifying the source or project style. 
- Explicitly state the license (e.g., MIT, GPL, Apache) when incorporating logic derived from open-source projects. Include links where possible.
- Alert the user if the suggested code requires a specific license header to be compliant.
- If code mirrors a specific repository's implementation, acknowledge this clearly. Provide a "clean-room" alternative if the original has restrictive licensing (e.g., AGPL).
