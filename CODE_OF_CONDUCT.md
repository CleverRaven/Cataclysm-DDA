## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

1. Assume other participants are posting in good faith, even if you disagree with what they say.
2. Make an effort to treat other participants with respect.
    1. Do not take a harsh tone towards other participants, and especially don't make personal attacks against them.
    2. Recognize that criticism of your statements is not a personal attack on you.
    3. Avoid statements about the presumed typical desires, capabilities or actions of some demographic group.
3. Be especially kind to other contributors when saying they made a mistake.
4. Don't argue unceasingly for your preferred course of action when a decision for some other course has already been made.
5. If other participants complain about the way you express your ideas, please make an effort to cater to them.
6. Don't raise unrelated political issues.
7. If you feel these standards are being violated, please alert the project lead Kevin Granade at kevin.granade@gmail.com
