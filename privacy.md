# Privacy Policy for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

**CleverRaven**, the group of internet randoms that make **Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead**, does not and cannot download or use your data, nor do we want to.  You know what kind of person you are so we're sure you understand why not.

You can see the source code of this game online for yourself to confirm this (_and even become a member of the contributor team if you want_) at https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/.

If you have questions about this privacy policy (though we can't imagine how that would be possible), please submit them as [a Github issue](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/issues/new/choose).

If you're wondering why we have a privacy policy at all in a single player locally-stored game, please direct further inquiries to Google's app store.

***

TLDR: **Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead** and **Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead (X)** apps do not collect or share any of your data.
