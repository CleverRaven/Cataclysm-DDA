# Variants


## What are variants?

Variants are CDDAs solution to allowing the same item have different names. It's used in guns to have generic or specific names changeable with a setting, or in items such as clothing to have lots of different colors without having a bunch of essentially duplicate entries for an item. They're a great way to add in extra variety to the game at a low cost to both effort, and file sizes. They were added in #51613 and #46814.

## What aren't variants?

Variants cannot change any stat of an item, besides the name, description, color, sprite, and symbol. They're nothing more than an aesthetic change and has no impact on gameplay. 

# Inclusion Criteria 

## Issues

As cool as variants are, sometimes issues can arise if there's too much variants of an item with nothing to reign them in. As an example, condoms had a few joke flavors that didn't make sense, and snowballed into other items having variants that were nothing more than jokes, such as chewing gum having fart, cat hairball, and zombie flavors. This doc aims to provide contributors with a good idea of what is, and isn't acceptable as variants. 

## Criteria 

### Foods

Variants for foods generally cover just flavors, as those tend to have little to no calorie difference. You should try to cover a base of flavors without being too specific. Strawberry, banana, raspberry flavours are acceptable as chewing gum flavors, while Crazy Carl's Supreme Strawberry Surprise flavor would not. You also want to avoid overlap, strawberry banana raspberry twist chewing gun doesn't add more variety than the individual variants already do. 

### Clothing

Clothing can benefit greatly from variants, as there's a lot of different clothes that have different colors. However, it shouldn't be too in the weeds for details. Aim for covering basic colors and patterns, while avoiding overly specific ones.  A pink hoodie is fine, but a shrimp pink hoodie or a cream and blue Rorschach polka dot hoodie is not.

### Guns 

Guns can have variants as well, such as the Ruger Mk IV having different versions, or the AK having different manufacturers. Gun variants should [this](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/2d2044925173e2e21dc65d3e7592f660e3e01104/doc/GUN_NAMING_AND_INCLUSION.md) doc for inclusion. However, being overly specific such as specifying a Glock 19 with red stippled grips and a dark gray slide is unneeded. You're aiming to cover different guns, not overly specific details. 

### Religious items 

Religous item variants should focus mainly on major religions. Stuff like Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, Heaven's Gate, Norse Mythology should be excluded or at the very least, very rare. 

### Misc items 

This is for items that don't fit into those categories, such as plushies, knives, etc. but also as a general guide for what isn't and isn't acceptable. Variants exist for the purpose of adding variety, not content. If you're adding variants and are having to specific what type of variant it is, you're in too deep. As an example, a bear plushie is fine, a panda bear plushie is not. Don't be overzealous with joke variants, one joke variant alone is not likely to be accepted while multiple surely aren't. Item variants should also try to follow what is present in the real world in meaningful numbers. For example, specifying a type of cigarette is a Golden Bat one is too specific, it's a rare collectors item that you have an essentially zero chance of actually finding, especially as a regular cigarette people are smoking and not one that is in a collection somewhere.
