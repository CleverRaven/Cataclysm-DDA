# Monster types

Monster types are specified as JSON object with "type" member set to "MONSTER":
```JSON
{
    "type": "MONSTER",
    "id": "mon_foo",
    ...
}
```

The id member should be the unique id of the type. It can be any string, by convention it has the prefix "mon_". This id can be referred to in various places, like monster groups or in mapgen to spawn specific monsters.

Monster types support the following properties (mandatory, except if noted otherwise):

## "name"
(string or object)

```JSON
"name": "cow"
```

```JSON
"name": { "ctxt": "fish", "str": "pike", "str_pl": "pikes" }
```

Name displayed in-game, and optionally the plural name and a translation context.
If the plural name is not specified, it defaults to singular name + "s".

## "description"
(string)

In-game description for the monster.

## "species"

## "size"
(string, optional)

## "attack_cost"
(integer, optional)

Number of moves per regular attack.

## "diff"
(integer, optional)

Monster baseline difficulty.  Impacts the shade used to label the monster, and if it is above 30 a kill will be recorded in the memorial log.  Monster difficult is calculated based on expected melee damage, dodge, armor, hit points, speed, morale, aggression, and vision ranges.  The calculation does not handle ranged special attacks or unique special attacks very well, and baseline difficulty can be used to account for that.  Suggested values:
2 - a limited defensive ability such as a skitterbot's taser, or a weak special like a shrieker zombie's special ability to alert nearby monsters, or a minor bonus to attack like poison or venom.
5 - a limited ranged attack weaker than spitter zombie's spit, or a powerful defensive ability like a shocker zombie's zapback or an acid zombie's acid spray.
10 - a powerful ranged attack, like a spitters zombie's spit or an turret's 9mm SMG.
15 - a powerful ranged attack with additional hazards, like a corrosize zombie's spit
20 - a very powerful ranged attack, like a laser turret or military turret's 5.56mm rifle, or a powerful special ability, like a zombie necromancer's ability to raise other zombies.
30 - a ranged attack that is deadly even for armored characters, like an anti-material turret's .50 BMG rifle.

Most monsters should have difficulty 0 - even dangerous monsters like a zombie hulk or razorclaw alpha.  Difficulty should only be used for exceptional, ranged, special attacks.

The old style array should contain 2 elements: the id of the attack (see JSON_FLAGS.md for a list) and the cooldown for that attack. Example (grab attack every 10 turns):
```JSON
"special_attack": [ [ "GRAB", 10 ] ]
```

The new style object should contain at least a "type" member (string) and "cooldown" member (integer). It may contain additional members as required by the specific type. Possible types are listed below. Example:
```JSON
"special_attack": [
    { "type": "leap", "cooldown": 10, "max_range": 4 }

    { "type": "leap", "cooldown": 10, "max_range": 4 }
]
```

One can add entries with "add:death_function", which takes the same content as the "special_attack" member and remove entries with "remove:death_function", which requires an array of attack types. Example:
```JSON
"remove:special_attack": [ "GRAB" ],
"add:special_attack": [ [ "SHRIEK", 20 ] ]

## "revert_to_itype"

## "starting_ammo"
(object, optional)

An object containing ammo that newly spawned monsters start with. This is useful for a monster that has a special attack that consumes ammo. Example:

```

## "upgrades"

Example:
```JSON
"upgrades": {

    "half_life": 28
}
```

The upgrades object may have the following members:

### "half_life"

Time in which half of the monsters upgrade according to an approximated exponential progression. It is scaled with the evolution scaling factor which defaults to 4 days.

### "into_group"
(string, optional)
The upgraded monster's type is taken from the specified group. The cost in these groups is for an upgrade in the spawn process (related to the rare "replace_monster_group" and "new_monster_group_id" attributes of spawning groups).

### "into"

### "baby_count"
(int)

### "baby_timer"
(int)

## "baby_flags"

## "special_when_hit"
(array, optional)

A special defense attack, triggered when the monster is attacked. It should contain an array with the id of the defense (see Monster defense attacks in JSON_FLAGS.md) and the chance for that defense to be actually triggered. Example:
```JSON
"special_when_hit": [ "ZAPBACK", 100 ]
```

## "attack_effs"
(array of objects, optional)

A set of effects that may get applied to the attacked creature when the monster successfully attacks. Example:
```JSON
"attack_effs": [
    {
        "id": "paralyzepoison",
        "duration": 33,
        "chance": 50
    }
]
```

Each element of the array should be an object containing the following members:

### "permanent"
(boolean, optional)

Whether the effect is permanent, in which case the "duration" will be ignored. The default is non-permanent.

### "chance"
(integer, optional)

The chance of the effect getting applied.



# Modding

Monster types can be overridden or modified in mods. To do so, one has to add an "edit-mode" member, which can contain either:
- "create" (the default if the member does not exist), an error will be shown if a type with the given id already exists.
- "override", an existing type (if any) with the given id will be removed and the new data will be loaded as a completely new type.
- "modify", an existing type will be modified. If there is no type with the given id, an error will be shown.

Mandatory properties (all that are not marked as optional) are only required if edit mode is "create" or "override".

Example (rename the zombie monster, leaves all other properties untouched):
```JSON
{
    "type": "MONSTER",
    "edit-mode": "modify",
    "id": "mon_zombie",
    "name": "clown"
}
```
The default edit mode ("create") is suitable for new types, if their id conflicts with the types from other mods or from the core data, an error will be shown. The edit mode "override" is suitable for re-defining a type from scratch, it ensures that all mandatory members are listed and leaves no traces of the previous definitions. Edit mode "modify" is for small changes, like adding a flag or removing a special attack.

Modifying a type overrides the properties with the new values, this example sets the special attacks to contain *only* the "SHRIEK" attack:
```JSON
{
    "type": "MONSTER",
    "edit-mode": "modify",
    "id": "mon_zombie",
    "special_attack": [ [ "SHRIEK", 20 ] ]
}
```
Some properties allow adding and removing entries, as documented above, usually via members with the "add:"/"remove:" prefix.
