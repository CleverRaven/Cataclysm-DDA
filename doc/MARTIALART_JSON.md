```

### Attack vectors

Attack vector is a way for game to separate which techniques could be used by character, and which could not - it would be odd to see player is unable to kick because their arm is broken

List of attack vectors is currently hardcoded, and contain:

- `HAND` - Any technique that hits with any part of the hand (backhand, jab, hammer fist). Can be used as long as at least one hand/arm limb is not broken.
- `FINGERS` - Any technique that hits with the fingers (eye gouge, spearhand). Can be used as long as at least one hand/arm limb is not broken.
- `PALM` - Any technique that hits with the palm of the hand(palm strike). Can be used as long as at least one hand/arm limb is not broken.
- `HAND_BACK` - Any technique that hits with the back of the hand(backfist, backhand slap). Can be used as long as at least one hand/arm limb is not broken.
- `WRIST` - Any technique that hits with the wrist (crane strike). Can be used as long as at least one hand/arm limb is not broken.
- `ARM` - Any technique that hits with the arm itself (clothesline). Can be used as long as at least one hand/arm limb is not broken.
- `ELBOW` - Any technique that hits with an elbow (elbow strike). Can be used as long as at least one hand/arm limb is not broken.
- `SHOULDER` - Any technique that hits with the upper part of the arm (shoulder check). Can be used as long as at least one hand/arm limb is not broken.
- `FOOT` - Any technique that hits with any part of the foot (roundhouse kick, foot stomp, heel drop). Can be used only if both legs are not broken. You need one functional leg to perform the attack and another functional leg to balance on.
- `LOWER_LEG` - Any technique that hits with shin (Muay Thai kicks). Can be used only if both legs are not broken. You need one functional leg to perform the attack and another functional leg to balance on.
- `KNEE` - Any technique that hits with the knee (knee bash). Can be used only if both legs are not broken. You need one functional leg to perform the attack and another functional leg to balance on.
- `HIP` - Any technique that hits with the hips or buttocks (Peach Bomber, R. Mika's Flying Peach). Can be used only if both legs are not broken. You need one functional leg to perform the attack and another functional leg to balance on.
- `TORSO` - Any technique that hits with the center mass of the user's body (flying body splash, throwing yourself at an enemy). Can always be used because if your Torso is broken, you are dead.  // Shouldn't it requre both legs? can't really use a whole body if legs are broken, no way to deliver the momentum ain't it?
- `HEAD` - Any technique that hits with the user's head such as a headbutt. Can always be used because if your Head is broken, you are dead.
- `WEAPON` - Any technique the requires a held item to perform (see any weapon style). Can be used if the user is holding a valid style weapon for their martial art and at least one hand/arm is not broken.
- `THROW` - Any technique that forcefully moves an opponent (judo throws, suplex). Can be used only if both hands/arms are not broken.
- `GRAPPLE` - Any technique that maintains contact with an opponent and squeezes (chock, headlock), bends (Krav Maga's Arm Breaker), or twists (arm twist) some part of the opponent. Can be used only if both hands/arms are not broken.
- `MOUTH` - A technique that uses the mouth to bite or spit on an opponent. Can be used only if the mouth is not covered by anything not flagged with ALLOWS_NATURAL_ATTACKS.

### Tech effects
```C++
"tech_effects": [
  {
    "id": "eff_expl",    // Unique ID. Must be one continuous word
    "chance": 100,       // Percent chance to apply the effect on this attack
    "permanent": false,  // If true the effect won't decay (default false)
    "duration": 15,      // Duration of the effect in turns
    "on_damage": true,   // If true the effect will only be applied if the attack succeeded in doing damage (default true)
    "req_flag": "ANY",   // A single arbitrary character flag (from traits, bionics, effects, or bodyparts) required to apply this effect
    "message": "Example" // The message to print if you successfully apply the effect, %s can be substituted for the target's name
  }
]
```

### Buffs

```C++
{
  "id": "debug_elem_resist",         // Unique ID. Must be one continuous word
  "name": "Elemental Resistance",    // In-game name displayed, would be shown in character menu
  "description": "You are a walking tank!\n\nBash armor increased by 100% of Strength, Cut armor increased by 100% of Dexterity, Electricic armor increased by 100% of Intelligence, and Fire armor increased by 100% of Perception", // In-game description, would be shown in character menu
  "buff_duration": 2,                // Duration in turns that this buff lasts
  "persists": false,                 // Allow buff to remain when changing to a new style
  "unarmed_allowed": true,           // Effect is applied when you have no weapon equipped
  "melee_allowed": true,             // Effect is applied when you have some melee weapon equipped
  "strictly_unarmed": true,          // Effect is applied only when you have no weapon whatsoever, even unarmed weapon
  "wall_adjacent": true,            // Effect is applied when you stand near the wall
  "weapon_categories_allowed": [ "BLADES", "KNIVES" ], // Restrict buff to only these categories of weapons. If omitted, all weapon categories are allowed.
  "max_stacks": 8,                   // Maximum number of stacks on the buff. Buff bonuses are multiplied by current buff intensity
  "bonus_blocks": 1,                 // Extra blocks per turn
  "bonus_dodges": 1,                 // Extra dodges per turn
  "flat_bonuses": [],                // Flat bonuses, see below
  "mult_bonuses": [],                // Multiplicative bonuses, see below
}
```

### Bonuses

The bonuses arrays contain any number of bonus entries like this:

```C++
{
  "stat": "damage",
  "type": "bash",
  "scaling-stat": "per",
  "scale": 0.15
}
```

"stat": affected statistic, any of: "hit", "dodge", "block", "speed", "movecost", "damage", "armor", "arpen",
"type": damage type for the affected statistic ("bash", "cut", "heat", etc.), only needed if the affected statistic is "damage", "armor", or "arpen".
"scale": the value of the bonus itself.
"scaling-stat": scaling stat, any of: "str", "dex", "int", "per", "bashing", "cutting", "dodge", "melee", "stabbing", "swimming", "unarmed", "marksmanship", "pistols", "rifles", "shotguns", "SMGs", "archery", "throwing", "launchers", "driving", "health care", "spellcraft". Optional. If the scaling stat is specified, the value of the bonus is multiplied by the corresponding user stat/skill.

Bonuses must be written in the correct order.

Tokens of `useless` type will not cause an error, but will not have any effect.
For example, `speed` in a technique will have no effect (`movecost` should be used for techniques). Multiplicative bonuses are only for `damage` and `movecost`.

Flat bonuses are applied after multiplicative bonuses.

Examples:
Incoming bashing damage is decreased by 30% of strength value. Only useful on buffs:
* `flat_bonuses: [ { "stat": "armor", "type": "bash", "scaling-stat": "str", "scale": 0.3 } ]`

All cutting damage dealt is multiplied by `(10% of dexterity)*(damage)`:
* `mult_bonuses: [ { "stat": "damage", "type": "cut", "scaling-stat": "dex", "scale": 0.1 } ]`

Move cost is decreased by 100% of strength value
* `flat_bonuses: [ { "stat": "movecost", "scaling-stat": "str", "scale": -1.0 } ]`

### Place relevant items in the world and chargen

Starting trait selection of your martial art goes in mutations.json. Place your art in the right category (self-defense, Shaolin animal form, melee style, etc)

Use json/itemgroups/ to place your martial art book and any martial weapons you've made for the art into spawns in various locations in the world. If you don't place your weapons in there, only recipes to craft them will be an option.
