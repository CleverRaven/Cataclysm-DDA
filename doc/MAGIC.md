## Spells

Spells in Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead consist in actions performed by a character or item, that result on a target or targets receiving an event.

This can be anything from the humble fireball spell or the simple heal, to granting states, mutations, summoning items and vehicles, spawning monsters, exploding monsters, applying auras, crowd-controlling, blinking, transforming terrain, adding or subtracting stats, granting or removing `effect_type`s, and more.

Remarkably, some things that don't seem quite "magical" at first glance may also be handled by spells, like casting Fist, casting Gun, casting Vomit, granting (or removing) `drunk`enness, handling fields (`field_id`s), transforming items, among other things.

By making clever use of JSON fields, interactions, combinations and descriptions, anyone can go wild in spell crafting.  Different spells from the official mods can be used as reference.

## The template spell

In `data/mods/Magiclysm` there is a template spell, copied here for your perusal:

```C++
  {
    // This spell exists in json as a template for contributors to see the possible values of the spell
    "id": "example_template",                                 // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
    "type": "SPELL",
    "name": "Template Spell",                                 // name of the spell that shows in game
    "description": "This is a template to show off all the available values",
    "valid_targets": [ "hostile", "ground", "self", "ally" ], // if a valid target is not included, you cannot cast the spell on that target.
    "effect": "shallow_pit",                                  // effects are coded in C++. A list will be provided below of possible effects that have been coded.

    "max_accuracy": 20,                                       // around 20 accuracy and it's basically impossible to block
    "accuracy_increment": 1.5
    "min_damage": 0,                                          // minimum damage (or "starting" damage)
    "max_damage": 100,                                        // maximum damage the spell can achieve
    "damage_increment": 2.5,                                  // to get damage (and any of the other below stats) multiply this by spell's level and add to minimum damage
    "min_aoe": 0,                                             // area of effect, or range of variance

    "max_duration": 1000,
    "duration_increment": 4,
    "min_pierce": 0,                                          // how much of the spell pierces armor
    "max_pierce": 1,
    "pierce_increment": 0.1,
    "field_id": "fd_blood",                                   // the string id of the field (currently hardcoded)
    "field_chance": 100,                                      // one_in( field_chance ) chance of spawning a field per tile in aoe
    "min_field_intensity": 10,                                // field intensity of fields generated
    "max_field_intensity": 10,
    "field_intensity_increment": 1,
    "field_intensity_variance": 0.1                           // the field can range in intensity from -variance as a percent to +variance as a percent i.e. this spell would be 9-11
    "sound_type": "combat",                                   // the type of sound. possible types are: background, weather, music, movement, speech, activity, destructive_activity, alarm, combat, alert, order
    "sound_description": "a whoosh",                          // the sound description. in the form of "You hear %s" by default it is "an explosion"
    "sound_ambient": true,                                    // whether or not this is treated as an ambient sound or not
    "sound_id": "misc",                                       // the sound id
    "sound_variant": "shockwave",                             // the sound variant
    "learn_spells": { "create_atomic_light": 5, "megablast": 10 }   // the caster will learn these spells when the current spell reaches the specified level. should be a map of spell_type_id and the level at which the new spell is learned.
  }
```
The template spell above shows every JSON field that spells can have.  Most of these values can be set at 0 or "NONE", so you may leave out most of these fields if they do not pertain to your spell.

When deciding values for some of these, it is important to note that some of the formulae are not linear.
For example, this is the formula for spell failure chance:

```( ( ( ( spell_level - spell_difficulty ) * 2 + intelligence + spellcraft_skill ) - 30 ) / 30 ) ^ 2```

Meaning a spell with difficulty 0 cast by a player with 8 intelligence, 0 spellcraft, and level 0 in the spell will have a 53% spell failure chance.
On the other hand, a player with 12 intelligence, 6 spellcraft, and level 6 in the same spell will have a 0% spell failure chance.

However, experience gain is a little more complicated to calculate.  The formula for how much experience you need to get to a level is below:

```e ^ ( ( level + 62.5 ) * 0.146661 ) ) - 6200```

## Mandatory fields

As noted above, few JSON fields are actually required for spells to work.  Some of the mandatory fields are:

| Identifier                  | Description
|---                          |---
| `id` |  Unique ID for the spell, used internally. Must be one continuous word, use underscores if necessary.
| `type` | Indicates the JSON object is a `SPELL`.
| `name` | Name of the spell that shows in game.
| `description` | Description of the spell that shows in game.
| `valid_targets` | Targets affected by the spell.  If a valid target is not included, you cannot cast the spell on that target.  Additionally, if the valid target is not specified, the spell aoe will not affect it.  Can be `ally`, `field`, `ground`, `hostile`, `item`, `none` or `self`.
| `effect` | Hardcoded spell behaviors, roughly speaking spell "type".  See the list below.
| `shape` | The shape of the spell's area of effect.  See the list below.

Depending on the spell effect, more or less fields will be required.  

For example, a classic `attack` spell needs the `damage_type`, `min_damage`, `max_damage`, `min_range`, `max_range`, and `max_level` fields.  

In contrast, an `attack` spell using `effect_str` to grant a `self` buff (without a damage component) needs the `min_duration`, `max_duration`, and `max_level` fields instead.


### Spell effects

Each spell effect is defined in the `effect` field. For example, the Magus spell "Magic Missile" has the `attack` effect, meaning it deals damage to a specific target:

```json
  {
    "id": "magic_missile",
    "effect": "attack",
    "min_damage": 1
  }
```

while the Druid spell "Nature's Bow" has the `spawn_item` effect, designating the ID of the item to spawn:

```json
  {
    "id": "druid_naturebow1",
    "effect": "spawn_item",
    "effect_str": "druid_recurve"
  }
```

Below is a table of currently implemented effects, along with special rules for how they work:

| Effect                   | Description
|---                       |---
| `area_pull` | Pulls `valid_targets` in its aoe toward the target location.  Currently, the pull distance is set to 1 (see `directed_push`).
| `area_push` | Pushes `valid_targets` in its aoe away from the target location.  Currently, the push distance is set to 1 (see `directed_push`).
| `attack` | Causes damage to `valid_targets` in its aoe, and applies `effect_str` named effect to targets.  To damage terrain use `bash`.
| `banishment` | Kills any `MONSTER` in the aoe up to damage hp.  Any overflow hp is taken from the caster; if it's more than the caster's hp the spell fails.
| `bash` | Bashes the terrain at the target.  Uses damage() as the strength of the bash.
| `charm_monster` | Charms a monster that has less hp than damage() for approximately duration().
| `dash` | Dashes forward up to range and hits targets in a cone at the target.
| `directed_push` | Pushes `valid_targets` in aoe away from the target location, with a distance of damage().  Negative values pull instead.
| `effect_on_condition` | Runs the `effect_on_condition` from `effect_str` on all valid targets.  The EOC will be centered on the player, with the NPC as caster.
| `emit` | Causes an `emit` at the target.
| `explosion` | Causes an explosion centered on the target.  Uses damage() for power and factor aoe()/10.
| `flashbang` | Causes a flashbang effect is centered on the target.  Uses damage() for power and factor aoe()/10.
| `fungalize` | Fungalizes the target.
| `guilt` | Target gets the guilt morale as if it killed the caster.
| `map` | Maps out the overmap centered on the player, to a radius of aoe().
| `mod_moves` | Adds damage() moves to the targets.  Negative values "freeze" for that amount of time.
| `morale` | Gives a morale effect to NPCs or the avatar within the aoe.  Uses damage() for the value.  `decay_start` is duration() / 10.
| `mutate` | Mutates the targets.  If `effect_str` is defined, mutates toward that category instead of picking at random.  If the `MUTATE_TRAIT` flag is used, allows `effect_str` to be a specific trait.  Damage() / 100 is the percent chance the mutation will be successful (10000 represents 100.00%).
| `pain_split` | Evens out all of your limbs' damage.
| `pull_target` | Attempts to pull the target towards the caster in a straight line.  If the path is blocked by impassable furniture or terrain, the effect fails.
| `recover_energy` | Recovers an energy source equal to damage of the spell.  The energy source is defined in `effect_str` and may be one of `BIONIC`, `FATIGUE`, `PAIN`, `MANA` or `STAMINA`.
| `remove_effect` | Removes `effect_str` effects from all creatures in the aoe.
| `remove_field` | Removes a `effect_str` field in the aoe.  Causes teleglow of varying intensity and potentially teleportation depending on field density, if the field removed is `fd_fatigue`.
| `revive` | Revives a monster like a zombie necromancer.  The monster must have the `REVIVES` flag.
| `short_range_teleport` | Teleports the player randomly range spaces with aoe variation.  See also the `TARGET_TELEPORT` and `UNSAFE_TELEPORT` flags.
| `spawn_item` | Spawns an item that will disappear at the end of its duration.  Default duration is 0.
| `summon` | Summons a `MONSTER` or `monstergroup` from `effect_str` that will disappear at the end of its duration.  Default duration is 0.  See also the `SPAWN_WITH_DEATH_DROPS` flag.
| `summon_vehicle` | Summons a `vehicle` from `effect_str` that will disappear at the end of its duration.  Default duration is 0.
| `targeted_polymorph` | A targeted monster is permanently transformed into the `MONSTER` specified by `effect_str`, if it has less HP than the spell's damage.  If `effect_str` is left empty, the target will transform into a random monster with a similar difficulty rating.  Alternatively, the `POLYMORPH_GROUP` flag can be used to pick a weighted ID from a `monstergroup`.  The player and NPCs are immune to this spell effect.
| `ter_transform` | Transforms the terrain and furniture in its aoe.  The chance of any one of the points in the aoe changing is 1 / (damage).  The `effect_str` is the ID of a `ter_furn_transform`.
| `timed_event` | Adds a timed event to the player only.  Valid timed events are: `amigara`, `artifact_light`, `dim`, `help`, `robot_attack`, `roots_die`, `spawn_wyrms`, `temple_flood`, `temple_open`, `temple_spawn`, `wanted`.  **NOTE**: This was added only for artifact active effects.  Support is limited, use at your own risk.
| `translocate` | Opens up a window that allows the caster to choose a translocation gate to teleport to.
| `upgrade` | Immediately upgrades a target `MONSTER`.
| `vomit` | Any creature within its aoe will instantly vomit, if it's able to do so.


### Spell shape

Another mandatory field is the spell shape. This dictates how the area of effect works:

| Shape | Description
| --    | --
| `blast` | A circular blast centered on the impact position.  Aoe value is the radius.
| `cone` | Fires a cone with an arc equal to aoe in degrees.
| `line` | Fires a line with a width equal to the aoe.


## Common fields

The following JSON fields are also used in spells and, while optional, greatly expand how spells can behave.


### Spell Flags

Flags allow you to provide additional customizations for spell effects, behavior, and limitations.
Spells may have any number of flags, for example:

```json
  {
    "id": "bless",
    "//": "Encumbrance on the mouth (verbal) or arms (somatic) affect casting success, but not legs.",
    "flags": [ "VERBAL", "SOMATIC", "NO_LEGS" ]
  }
```

| Flag | Description
| ---  | ---
| `CONCENTRATE` | Focus affects spell fail %.
| `EXTRA_EFFECTS_FIRST` | The spell's `extra_effects` will happen before the main spell effect.
| `FRIENDLY_POLY` | The target of a `targeted_polymorph` spell will become friendly to the caster if the spell resolves successfully.
| `HOSTILE_SUMMON` | Summon spell always spawns a hostile monster.
| `HOSTILE_50` | Summoned monster spawns friendly 50% of the time.
| `IGNORE_WALLS` | Spell's aoe goes through walls.
| `LOUD` | Spell makes extra noise at target.
| `MUTATE_TRAIT` | Overrides the `mutate` spell effect to use a specific trait_id instead of a category.
| `NO_EXPLOSION_SFX` | The spell will not generate a visual explosion effect.
| `NO_HANDS` | Hands do not affect spell energy cost.
| `NO_LEGS` | Legs do not affect casting time.
| `NO_PROJECTILE` | The "projectile" portion of the spell phases through walls, the epicenter of the spell effect is exactly where you target it, with no regards to obstacles.
| `NON_MAGICAL` | Ignores spell resistance when calculating damage mitigation.
| `PAIN_NORESIST` | Pain altering spells can't be resisted (like with the deadened trait).
| `PERMANENT` | Items or creatures spawned with this spell do not disappear and die as normal.  Items can only be permanent at maximum spell level; creatures can be permanent at any spell level.
| `PERMANENT_ALL_LEVELS` | Items spawned with this spell do not disappear even if the spell is not max level.
| `POLYMORPH_GROUP` | A `targeted_polymorph` spell will transform the target into a random monster from the `monstergroup` in `effect_str`.
| `RANDOM_AOE` | Picks random number between (min + increment) * level and max instead of normal behavior.
| `RANDOM_DAMAGE` | Picks random number between (min + increment) * level and max instead of normal behavior.
| `RANDOM_DURATION` | Picks random number between (min + increment) * level and max instead of normal behavior.
| `RANDOM_TARGET` | Forces the spell to choose a random valid target within range instead of the caster choosing the target.  This also affects `extra_effects`.
| `SILENT` | Spell makes no noise at target.
| `SOMATIC` | Arm encumbrance affects fail % and casting time (slightly).
| `SPAWN_GROUP` | Spawn or summon from an `item_group` or `monstergroup`, instead of the specific IDs.
| `SPAWN_WITH_DEATH_DROPS` | Allows summoned monsters to retain their usual death drops, otherwise they drop nothing.
| `SWAP_POS` | A projectile spell swaps the positions of the caster and target.
| `TARGET_TELEPORT` | Teleport spell changes to maximum range target with aoe as variation around target.
| `UNSAFE_TELEPORT` | Teleport spell risks killing the caster or others.
| `VERBAL` | Spell makes noise at caster location, mouth encumbrance affects fail %.
| `WITH_CONTAINER` | Items spawned with container.
| `WONDER` | This drastically alters the behavior of the parent spell: The spell itself doesn't cast, but the damage and range information are used to cast the `extra_effects`.  A n number of `extra_effects` will be chosen to be cast at random, where n is the current damage of the spell (stacks with the `RANDOM_DAMAGE` flag), the message of the casted spell will also be displayed.  If this spell's message is not wanted, make sure `message` is an empty string.


### Damage Types

The following are the available damage types, for those spells that have a damaging component:

| Damage type             | Description
|---                      |---
| `acid` | 
| `bash` | 
| `biological` | Internal damage such as poison.
| `cold` | 
| `cut` | 
| `electric` | 
| `heat` | 
| `pure` | This damage type goes through armor altogether.  Set by default.
| `stab` | 


### Spell level

Spells can change effects as they level up.  "Effect" in this context can be: accuracy, aoe, damage, dot, duration, pierce and range, also including energy cost (as `base_energy_cost`, `final_energy_cost`, `energy_increment`) and field intensity (`min_field_intensity`, `max_field_intensity`, `field_intensity_increment` plus `field_intensity_variance`).

The level cap is indicated by the `max_level` field, and the effect growth is indicated with the `min_effect`, `max_effect` and `effect_increment` fields.  The min_effect is what the spell will do at level 0, and the max_effect is where it stops growing.  The effect_increment is how much it changes per level.

For example:

```json
...
    "min_range": 1,
    "max_range": 25,
    "range_increment": 5,
...
```

Min and max values must always have the same sign, but it can be negative e.g. in the case of spells that use a negative 'recover' effect to cause pain or stamina damage. For example:

```json
  {
    "id": "stamina_damage",
    "type": "SPELL",
    "name": "Tired",
    "description": "decreases stamina",
    "valid_targets": [ "hostile" ],
    "min_damage": -2000,
    "max_damage": -10000,
    "damage_increment": -3000,
    "max_level": 10,
    "effect": "recover_energy",
    "effect_str": "STAMINA"
  }
```


### Learning Spells

There multiple ways to learn spells: learning a spell from an item (through a `use_action`), from spells that have the `learn_spells` field, and from traits/mutations.  An example is shown below:

```json
  {
    "id": "DEBUG_spellbook",
    "type": "GENERIC",
    "name": "A Technomancer's Guide to Debugging C:DDA",
    "description": "static std::string description( spell sp ) const;",
    "weight": 1,
    "volume": "1 ml",
    "symbol": "?",
    "color": "magenta",
    "use_action": {
    "type": "learn_spell",
    "//": "list of spells you can learn from the item",
    "spells": [ "debug_hp", "debug_stamina", "example_template", "debug_bionic", "pain_split", "fireball" ]
    }
  }
```

You can study this spellbook for a rate of ~1 experience per turn depending on intelligence, spellcraft, and focus.

Below is an example of `learn_spells` usage:
```json
  {
    "id": "phase_door",
    "type": "SPELL",
    "name": "Phase Door",
    "description": "Teleports you in a random direction a short distance.",
    "effect": "short_range_teleport",
    "shape": "blast",
    "valid_targets": [ "none" ],
    "max_level": 10,
    "difficulty": 2,
    "spell_class": "MAGUS",
    "learn_spells": { "dimension_door": 10 }
  }
```

Traits/mutations have the `spells_learned` field, see the [JSON_INFO](JSON_INFO.md) documentation for details.


### Extra spell effects

Another two interesting fields are `extra_effects` and `effect_str`:

* `extra_effects` allows to cast one or more spells simultaneously, thus enabling "chain" style casting.

* `effect_str` works as a pointer, it links the main spell to a certain JSON object.  Behavior can vary depending on the spell's `effect`, e.g. it may define which `effect_type` will be applied the target, the ID of the `spawn_item`, `monster` or `vehicle` to spawn, etc.  Do note that some effect types are hardcoded, like `beartrap`, `crushed`, `dazed`, `downed`, `stunned`, etc. (non-exhaustive list!).


## Adding spells to professions and NPCs

You can add spells to professions or NPC class definitions like this:

```json
  {
    "id": "test_profession",
    "type": "profession",
    "name": "Test Professioner",
    "description": "Tests professions",
    "spells": [ { "id": "summon_zombie", "level": 0 }, { "id": "magic_missile", "level": 10 } ],
    ...
  }
```

**Note:** This makes it possible to learn spells that conflict with a class. It also does not give the prompt to gain the class. Be judicious upon adding this to a profession!

## Examples

The following are some spell examples, from simple to advanced:

### Summon spell

```C++
  {
    "type": "SPELL",
    "id": "test_summon",                                     // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
    "name": "Summon",                                        // name of the spell that shows in game
    "description": "Summons the creature specified in 'effect_str'",
    "flags": [ "SILENT", "HOSTILE_SUMMON" ],  // see "Spell Flags" in this document
    "valid_targets": [ "ground" ],                           // if a valid target is not included, you cannot cast the spell on that target.
    "min_damage": 1,                                         // minimum number of creatures summoned (or "starting" number of creatures summoned)
    "max_damage": 1,                                         // maximum number of creatures summoned the spell can achieve
    "min_aoe": 3,                                            // area of effect of the spell, in this case the area the summons can appear in
    "max_aoe": 3,
    "effect": "summon",                                      // effects are coded in C++. A list is provided in this document of possible effects that have been coded.
    "effect_str": "mon_test_monster",                        // varies, see table of implemented effects in this document
    "min_duration": 6250,                                    // duration of spell effect in moves (if the spell has a special effect)
    "max_duration": 6250
  }
```

Self explanatory: when cast, `test_summon` will silently summon 1 hostile `mon_test_monster` on a random 3x3 location centered around the caster, with a duration of 62.5 seconds, after which it will disappear.

### Typical attack

```C++
  {
    "id": "test_attack",                                     // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
    "type": "SPELL",
    "name": "Ranged Strike",                                 // name of the spell that shows in game
    "description": "Deals damage to the target with 100% accuracy. Will always apply the status effect specified in 'effect_str'.",
    "valid_targets": [ "ground", "hostile" ],                // if a valid target is not included, you cannot cast the spell on that target.
    "effect": "attack",                                      // effects are coded in C++. A list is provided in this document of possible effects that have been coded.
    "effect_str": "stunned",                                 // varies, see table of implemented effects in this document
    "min_damage": 10,                                        // minimum damage (or "starting" damage)
    "max_damage": 20,                                        // maximum damage the spell can achieve
    "damage_increment": 1.0,                                 // How much damage increases per spell level increase
    "min_range": 4,                                          // range of the spell
    "max_range": 4,
    "base_casting_time": 500,                                // this is the casting time (in moves)
    "min_duration": 200,                                     // duration of spell effect in moves (if the spell has a special effect)
    "max_duration": 300,
    "duration_increment": 10,                                // How much longer the spell lasts per spell level
    "damage_type": "stab"                                    // type of damage
  }
```

Explanation: classic damage spell with designated effect.  After a 5 second cast, a lvl 1 `test_attack` will deal 11 stab damage up to 4 tiles away, and stun the `hostile` target for 2.1 seconds.

Note: `valid_targets` has both `ground` and `hostile` so it can be targeted in an area with no line of sight.


### Consecutive spell casting

```C++
  {
    "id": "test_combo",                                      // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
    "type": "SPELL",
    "name": "Combo Strikes",                                 // name of the spell that shows in game
    "description": "Upon casting this spell, will also activate the spells specified on the 'extra_effects' in descending order.",
    "flags": [ "SILENT", "RANDOM_DAMAGE", "RANDOM_AOE" ],    // see "Spell Flags" in this document
    "valid_targets": [ "hostile", "ground" ],                // if a valid target is not included, you cannot cast the spell on that target.
    "effect": "attack",                                      // effects are coded in C++. A list is provided in this document of possible effects that have been coded.
    "effect_str": "downed",                                  // varies, see table of implemented effects in this document
    "extra_effects": [ { "id": "test_atk1" }, { "id": "test_atk2" } ],               // this allows you to cast multiple spells with only one spell
    "min_damage": 7,                                         // minimum damage (or "starting" damage)
    "max_damage": 14,                                        // maximum  damage the spell can achieve
    "damage_increment": 0.7                                  // damage increase per spell level
    "min_aoe": 2,                                            // area of effect
    "max_aoe": 4,
    "aoe_increment": 0.2,                                    // how much wider the area of effect gets per spell level
    "min_range": 10,                                         // range of the spell
    "max_range": 10,
    "base_casting_time": 750,                                // this is the casting time (in moves)
    "min_duration": 325,                                     // duration of spell effect in moves (if the spell has a special effect)
    "max_duration": 325,
    "damage_type": "stab"                                    // type of damage
  }
```

Explanation: If you put two or more spells in `extra_effects`, it will consecutively cast the spells: first `extra_effects`, second `extra_effects`, third `extra_effects`, etc.  If you wish to pick one at random, use the `WONDER` flag (see below).  Additionally, the extra spells will be cast at a level up to the level of the parent spell being cast, unless additional data is added to each `test_atk#`.


### Random spell casting

```C++
  {
    "id": "test_starter_spell",                              // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
    "type": "SPELL",
    "name": "Starter",                                       // name of the spell that shows in game
    "description": "Upon casting this spell, randomly selects one spell specified in 'extra_effects' to cast. The spell damage shows how many times it will randomly select from the list",
    "flags": [ "SILENT", "WONDER", "RANDOM_DAMAGE" ],        // see "Spell Flags" in this document
    "valid_targets": [ "hostile" ],                          // if a valid target is not included, you cannot cast the spell on that target.
    "effect": "attack",                                      // effects are coded in C++. A list is provided in this document of possible effects that have been coded.
    "extra_effects": [                                       // this allows you to cast multiple spells with only one spell
      { "id": "test_atk1" },                                 // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
      { "id": "test_atk2" },                                 // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
      { "id": "test_atk3" },                                 // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
      { "id": "test_atk4" },                                 // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
      { "id": "test_atk5" },                                 // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
      { "id": "test_atk6" }                                  // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
    ],
    "min_damage": 3,                                         // minimum damage (or "starting" damage)
    "max_damage": 5,                                         // maximum damage the spell can achieve
    "damage_increment": 0.2                                  // damage increase per spell level
    "min_range": 10,                                         // range of the spell
    "max_range": 10
  }
```

Explanation: The `WONDER` flag does wonders by turning the spell into a dice: When cast, the main spell will pick the subspells in `extra_effects`.  The amount of "rolls" is specified via `min_damage` and `max_damage` plus the `RANDOM_DAMAGE` flag.  In this example, casting `test_starter_spell` will cause any one of each `test_atk#` subspells to be selected, this repeats 3 to 5 times.

Note: There must be a minimum of one spell in `extra_effects` for the `WONDER` flag to work properly.


### Repeatedly cast the same spell

```C++
  {
    "type": "SPELL",
    "id": "test_attack_repeat",                              // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
    "name": "a spell",                                       // name of the spell that shows in game
    "description": "Upon casting this spell it will repeat the spell specified in `extra_effects` - the amount of repetitions is the interval `min_damage`-`max_damage` ",
    "extra_effects": [ { "id": "test_attack" } ],            // this allows you to cast multiple spells with only one spell
    "flags": [ "SILENT", "WONDER", "RANDOM_DAMAGE" ],        // see "Spell Flags" in this document
    "valid_targets": [ "hostile" ],                          // if a valid target is not included, you cannot cast the spell on that target.
    "effect": "attack",                                      // effects are coded in C++. A list is provided in this document of possible effects that have been coded.
    "effect_str": "target_message",                          // varies, see table of implemented effects in this document
    "min_damage": 5,                                         // minimum (starting damage)
    "max_damage": 7,                                         // maximum damage the spell can achieve
    "damage_increment": 0.2                                  // damage increase per spell level
    "min_range": 10,                                         // range of the spell
    "max_range": 10,
    "min_duration": 1,                                       // duration of spell effect in moves (if the spell has a special effect)
    "max_duration": 1
  }
```

Explanation: Notice a different approach for the `WONDER` and `RANDOM_DAMAGE` combo: `min_damage` set to 5 and `max_damage` set to 7 will cause the main spell to "roll" `extra_effects` 5 - 7 times, but this time there's a single `test_attack`.  Because `WONDER` has a 100% chance of picking a spell, `test_attack`, will be repeated 5 to 7 times.


### A spell that casts a note on the target and an effect on the caster

```C++
  {
    "id": "test_attack_note",                                // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
    "type": "SPELL",
    "name": "a note",                                        // name of the spell that shows in game
    "description": "This spell applies a harmless status effect to notify the player about the spell that the user has cast.",
    "flags": [ "SILENT" ],                                   // see "Spell Flags" in this document
    "valid_targets": [ "hostile" ],                          // if a valid target is not included, you cannot cast the spell on that target.
    "effect": "attack",                                      // effects are coded in C++. A list is provided in this document of possible effects that have been coded.
    "extra_effects": [ { "id": "sacrifice_spell", "hit_self": true }, { "id": "test_attack" } ],     // this allows you to cast multiple spells with only one spell
    "effect_str": "eff_test_note",                           // varies, see table of implemented effects in this document
    "min_aoe": 6,                                            // area of effect, or range of variance
    "max_aoe": 6,
    "min_duration": 1,                                       // duration of spell effect in moves (if the spell has a special effect)
    "max_duration": 1
  }
```

Explanation: Here we have one main spell with two subspells: one on the caster and the other on the target.  To do this, you must specify the ID of whatever spells you're using with the `extra_effects` field.  In this case, `sacrifice_spell` is stated with `"hit_self": true` and will "hit" the caster, while the second spell will be cast as normal on the `hostile` target.  This is only necessary if we need an effect that is cast on a target and a secondary effect cast on the caster.


### Monster spells

`MONSTER`s can also cast spells.  To do this, you need to declare the spells in `special_attacks`.  Spells with `target_self: true` will only target the casting monster, and will be casted only if the monster has a hostile target.

```json 
  { 
    "type": "spell", 
    "spell_data": { "id": "cone_cold", "min_level": 4 }, 
    "monster_message": "%1$s casts %2$s at %3$s!", 
    "cooldown": 25 
  }
```

| Identifier              | Description
|---                      |---
| `spell_data`            | List of spell properties for the attack.
| `min_level`             | The level at which the spell is cast. Spells cast by monsters do not gain levels like player spells.
| `cooldown `             | How often the monster can cast this spell
| `monster_message`       | Message to print when the spell is cast, replacing the `message` in the spell definition. Dynamic fields correspond to `<Monster Display Name> / <Spell Name> / <Target name>`.
| `forbidden_effects_any` | Array of effect IDs, if the monster has any one the attack can't trigger.
| `forbidden_effects_all` | Array of effect IDs, if the monster has every effect the attack can't trigger.
| `required_effects_any`  | Array of effect IDs, the monster needs any one for the attack to trigger.
| `required_effects_all`  | Array of effect IDs, the monster needs every effect for the attack to trigger.
| `allow_no_target`       | Bool, default `false`. If `true` the monster will cast it even without a hostile target.


## Enchantments

A subtype of spells are enchantments.  Enchantments can be considered physical spells, as these rely on item entities as "containers", and are automatically activated depending on the specified usage and `condition`, instead of being `a`ctivated directly or casted by someone.

Depending on their effects on the user, enchantments can behave like blessings, by granting positive stats and subspells, curses if such effects are detrimental to the user (through a clever use of the `NO_TAKEOFF` flag), or a mix of both.


| Identifier                  | Description
|---                          |---
| `id`                        | Unique ID.  Must be one continuous word, use underscores if necessary.
| `has`                       | How an enchantment determines if it is in the right location in order to qualify for being active.  `WIELD` when wielded in your hand, `WORN` when worn as armor, `HELD` when in your inventory.
| `condition`                 | Determines the environment where the enchantment is active. `ALWAYS` is active always and forevermore, `DIALOG_CONDITION - ACTIVE` whenever the dialog condition in `condition` is true, `ACTIVE` whenever the item, mutation, bionic, or whatever the enchantment is attached to is active, `INACTIVE` whenever the item, mutation, bionic, or whatever the enchantment is attached to is inactive.
| `hit_you_effect`            | A spell that activates when you `melee_attack` a creature.  The spell is centered on the location of the creature unless `"hit_self": true`, then it is centered on your location.  Follows the template for defining `fake_spell`.
| `hit_me_effect`             | A spell that activates when you are hit by a creature.  The spell is centered on your location.  Follows the template for defining `fake_spell`
| `intermittent_activation`   | Spells that activate centered on you depending on the duration.  The spells follow the `fake_spell` template.
| `values`                    | Anything that is a number that can be modified.  The ID field is required, `add` and `multiply` are optional.  A `multiply` value of -1 is -100% and 2.5 is +250%.  `add` is always applied before `multiply`.  Allowed ID values are shown below.  Either "add" or "multiply" can be a variable_object/arithmetic expression(see [NPCs](NPCs.md)).  If a "multiply" value is a variable_object/arithmetic it will be multiplied by .01 before use as decimals cannot be variable values.  So a variable with 100 would become 1, it is treated as a percent effectively.

```json
  {
    "type": "enchantment",
    "id": "MEP_INK_GLAND_SPRAY",
    "hit_me_effect": [
      {
        "id": "generic_blinding_spray_1",
        "hit_self": false,
        "once_in": 15,
        "message": "Your ink glands spray some ink into %2$s's eyes.",
        "npc_message": "%1$s's ink glands spay some ink into %2$s's eyes."
      }
    ]
  }
```  

```json
  {
    "type": "enchantment",
    "id": "ENCH_INVISIBILITY",
    "condition": "ALWAYS",
    "ench_effects": [ { "effect": "invisibility", "intensity": 1 } ],
    "has": "WIELD",
    "hit_you_effect": [ { "id": "AEA_FIREBALL" } ],
    "hit_me_effect": [ { "id": "AEA_HEAL" } ],
    "values": [ { "value": "STRENGTH", "multiply": 1.1, "add": -5 } ],
    "intermittent_activation": {
      "effects": [
        {
          "frequency": "1 hour",
          "spell_effects": [
            { "id": "AEA_ADRENALINE" }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```

To add the enchantment to the item, you need add the enchantment ID inside the `relic_data` field. For example:

```json
...
"relic_data": { "passive_effects": [ { "id": "ench_fishform" } ] },
...
```

If your enchantment is relatively small, you can write it right in the same JSON object, using the same syntaxis as a common enchantment. For example:

```json
...
  "relic_data": {
    "passive_effects": [
      {
        "has": "WORN",
        "condition": "ALWAYS",
        "values": [
          { "value": "ARMOR_CUT", "add": -4 },
          { "value": "ARMOR_BASH", "add": -4 },
          { "value": "ARMOR_STAB", "add": -4 },
          { "value": "ARMOR_BULLET", "add": -2 }
        ]    
      }
    ]
  },
...
```


### ID values
