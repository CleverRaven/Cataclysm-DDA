# How to add magic to a mod

### Spells

In `data/mods/Magiclysm` there is a template spell, copied here for your perusal:

```C++
{
    // This spell exists in json as a template for contributors to see the possible values of the spell
	"id": "example_template",                                 // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
	"type": "SPELL",
	"name": "Template Spell",                                 // name of the spell that shows in game
	"description": "This is a template to show off all the available values",
	"valid_targets": [ "hostile", "ground", "self", "ally" ], // if a valid target is not included, you cannot cast the spell on that target.
	"effect": "shallow_pit",                                  // effects are coded in C++. A list will be provided below of possible effects that have been coded.

	"aoe_increment": 0.1,
	"min_range": 1,                                           // range of the spell
	"max_range": 10,
	"range_increment": 2,
	"min_dot": 0,                                             // damage over time (currently not implemented)
	"max_dot": 2,
	"dot_increment": 0.1,
	"min_duration": 0,                                        // duration of spell effect (if the spell has a special effect)
	"max_duration": 1000,
	"duration_increment": 4,
	"min_pierce": 0,                                          // how much of the spell pierces armor (currently not implemented)
	"max_pierce": 1,

	"min_field_intensity": 10,                                // field intensity of fields generated
	"max_field_intensity": 10,
	"field_intensity_increment": 1,
	"field_intensity_variance": 0.1                           // the field can range in intensity from -variance as a percent to +variance as a percent i.e. this spell would be 9-11
	"sound_type": "combat",                                   // the type of sound. possible types are: background, weather, music, movement, speech, activity, destructive_activity, alarm, combat, alert, order
	"sound_description": "a whoosh",                          // the sound description. in the form of "You hear %s" by default it is "an explosion"
	"sound_ambient": true,                                    // whether or not this is treated as an ambient sound or not
	"sound_id": "misc",                                       // the sound id
	"sound_variant": "shockwave"                              // the sound variant
  }
```
Most of the default values for the above are either 0 or "NONE", so you may leave out most of the values if they do not pertain to your spell.

When deciding values for some of these, it is important to note that some of the formulae are not linear.
For example, this is the formula for spell failure chance:

```( ( ( ( spell_level - spell_difficulty ) * 2 + intelligence + spellcraft_skill ) - 30 ) / 30 ) ^ 2```

Meaning a spell with difficulty 0 cast by a player with 8 intelligence, 0 spellcraft, and level 0 in the spell will have a 53% spell failure chance.
On the other hand, a player with 12 intelligence, 6 spellcraft, and level 6 in the same spell will have a 0% spell failure chance.

However, experience gain is a little more complicated to calculate.  The formula for how much experience you need to get to a level is below:

```e ^ ( ( level + 62.5 ) * 0.146661 ) ) - 6200```

### Spell effects and rules

The value of the `"effect"` string in the spell's JSON data says what effect the spell has. For example, the Magus spell "Magic Missile" has a `target_attack` effect, meaning it deals damage to a specific target:

```json
{
  "id": "magic_missile",
  "effect": "attack",
  "min_damage": 1
}
```

while the Druid spell "Nature's Bow" has a `spawn_item` effect, and requires the name of the item to spawn:

```json
{
  "id": "druid_naturebow1",
  "effect": "spawn_item",
  "effect_str": "druid_recurve"
}
```

Below is a table of currently implemented effects, along with special rules for how they work:

| Effect                   | Description
|---                       |---
| `pain_split` | makes all of your limbs' damage even out
| `move_earth` | "digs" at the target location. some terrain is not diggable this way.
| `attack` | "causes damage to targets in its aoe, and applies an effect to the targets named by `effect_str`
| `spawn_item` | spawns an item that will disappear at the end of its duration.  Default duration is 0.
| `summon` | summons a monster ID or group ID from `effect_str` that will disappear at the end of its duration.  Default duration is 0.
| `teleport_random` | teleports the player randomly range spaces with aoe variation
| `recover_energy` | recovers an energy source equal to damage of the spell. The energy source recovered is defined in "effect_str" and may be one of "MANA", "STAMINA", "FATIGUE", "PAIN", "BIONIC"
| `ter_transform` | transform the terrain and furniture in an area centered at the target.  The chance of any one of the points in the area of effect changing is one_in( damage ).  The effect_str is the id of a ter_furn_transform.
| `vomit` | any creature within its area of effect will instantly vomit, if it's able to do so.
| `timed_event` | adds a timed event to the player only. valid timed events: "help", "wanted", "robot_attack", "spawn_wyrms", "amigara", "roots_die", "temple_open", "temple_flood", "temple_spawn", "dim", "artifact_light" NOTE: This was added only for artifact active effects. support is limited, use at your own risk.
| `explosion` | an explosion is centered on the target, with power damage() and factor aoe()/10
| `flashbang` | a flashbang effect is centered on the target, with poewr damage() and factor aoe()/10
| `mod_moves` | adds damage() moves to the target. can be negative to "freeze" the target for that amount of time
| `map` | maps the overmap centered on the player out to a radius of aoe()
| `morale` | gives a morale effect to all npcs or avatar within aoe, with value damage(). decay_start is duration() / 10.
| `charm_monster` | charms a monster that has less hp than damage() for approximately duration()
| `mutate` | mutates the target(s). if effect_str is defined, mutates toward that category instead of picking at random. the "MUTATE_TRAIT" flag allows effect_str to be a specific trait instead of a category. damage() / 100 is the percent chance the mutation will be successful (a value of 10000 represents 100.00%)
| `bash` | bashes the terrain at the target. uses damage() as the strength of the bash.

Another mandatory member is spell "shape". This dictates how the area of effect works.

| Shape | Description
| --    | --
| `blast` | a standard circular blast that goes outward from the impact position. aoe value is the radius.
| `line` | fires a line with a width equal to the aoe
| `cone` | fires a cone with an arc equal to aoe in degrees


### Spell Flags

Flags allow you to provide additional customizations for spell effects, behavior, and limitations.
Spells may have any number of flags, for example:

```json
 {
    "id": "bless",
    "//": "Encumbrance on the mouth (verbal) or arms (somatic) affect casting success, but not legs.",
    "flags": [ "VERBAL", "SOMATIC", "NO_LEGS" ]
 }
```

| Flag | Description
| ---  | ---
| `WONDER` | This alters the behavior of the parent spell drastically: The spell itself doesn't cast, but its damage and range information is used in order to cast the extra_effects.  N of the extra_effects will be chosen at random to be cast, where N is the current damage of the spell (stacks with RANDOM_DAMAGE flag) and the message of the spell cast by this spell will also be displayed.  If this spell's message is not wanted to be displayed, make sure the message is an empty string.
| `RANDOM_TARGET` | Forces the spell to choose a random valid target within range instead of the caster choosing the target. This also affects extra_effects.
| `RANDOM_DURATION` | picks random number between min+increment*level and max instead of normal behavior
| `RANDOM_DAMAGE` | picks random number between min+increment*level and max instead of normal behavior
| `RANDOM_AOE` | picks random number between min+increment*level and max instead of normal behavior
| `PERMANENT` | items or creatures spawned with this spell do not disappear and die as normal.  Items can only be permanent at maximum spell level; creatures can be permanent at any spell level.
| `IGNORE_WALLS` | spell's aoe goes through walls
| `SWAP_POS` | a projectile spell swaps the positions of the caster and target
| `HOSTILE_SUMMON` | summon spell always spawns a hostile monster
| `HOSTILE_50` | summoned monster spawns friendly 50% of the time
| `SILENT` | spell makes no noise at target
| `LOUD` | spell makes extra noise at target
| `VERBAL` | spell makes noise at caster location, mouth encumbrance affects fail %
| `SOMATIC` | arm encumbrance affects fail % and casting time (slightly)
| `NO_HANDS` | hands do not affect spell energy cost
| `NO_LEGS` | legs do not affect casting time
| `CONCENTRATE` | focus affects spell fail %
| `MUTATE_TRAIT` | overrides the mutate spell_effect to use a specific trait_id instead of a category
| `PAIN_NORESIST` | pain altering spells can't be resisted (like with the deadened trait)
| `WITH_CONTAINER` | items spawned with container
| `UNSAFE_TELEPORT` | teleport spell risks killing the caster or others
| `SPAWN_GROUP` | spawn or summon from an item or monster group, instead of individual item/monster ID
| `NO_PROJECTILE` | the "projectile" portion of the spell phases through walls. the epicenter of the spell effect is exactly where you target it with no regards to obstacles


### Damage Types

For Spells that have an attack type, these are the available damage types:

* "fire"
* "acid"
* "bash"
* "bio" - internal damage such as poison
* "cold"
* "cut"
* "electric"
* "stab"
* "none" - this damage type goes through armor altogether. it is the default.

### Spells that level up

Spells that change effects as they level up must have a min and max effect and an increment. The min effect is what the spell will do at level 0, and the max effect is where it stops growing.  The increment is how much it changes per level. For example:

```json
"min_range": 1,
"max_range": 25,
"range_increment": 5,
```

Min and max values must always have the same sign, but it can be negative eg. in the case of spells that use a negative 'recover' effect to cause pain or stamina damage. For example:

```json
{
  "id": "stamina_damage",
  "type": "SPELL",
  "name": "Tired",
  "description": "decreases stamina",
  "valid_targets": [ "hostile" ],
  "min_damage": -2000,
  "max_damage": -10000,
  "damage_increment": -3000,
  "max_level": 10,
  "effect": "recover_energy",
  "effect_str": "STAMINA"
}
```

### Learning Spells

Currently there is only one way of learning spells that is implemented: learning a spell from an item, through a use_action.  An example is shown below:

```json
{
  "id": "DEBUG_spellbook",
  "type": "GENERIC",
  "name": "A Technomancer's Guide to Debugging C:DDA",
  "description": "static std::string description( spell sp ) const;",
  "weight": 1,
  "volume": "1 ml",
  "symbol": "?",
  "color": "magenta",
  "use_action": {
    "type": "learn_spell",
    "//": "list of spells you can learn from the item",
    "spells": [ "debug_hp", "debug_stamina", "example_template", "debug_bionic", "pain_split", "fireball" ]
  }
},
```

You can study this spellbook for a rate of ~1 experience per turn depending on intelligence, spellcraft, and focus.


### Spells in professions and NPC classes

You can add a "spell" member to professions or an NPC class definition like so:

```json
"spells": [ { "id": "summon_zombie", "level": 0 }, { "id": "magic_missile", "level": 10 } ]
```

NOTE: This makes it possible to learn spells that conflict with a class. It also does not give the prompt to gain the class. Be judicious upon adding this to a profession!

### Spell examples

Below you can see the proper examples of monster spells - most common types and even some advanced ones:

Spell types:

1) Summon:
```
    {
    "type": "SPELL",
    "id": "test_summon",                                       // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
    "name": "Summon",                                          // name of the spell that shows in game
    "description": "Summons the creature specified in 'effect_str'",
    "flags": [ "SILENT", "HOSTILE_SUMMON" ],  // see "Spell Flags" in this document
    "valid_targets": [ "ground" ],                             // if a valid target is not included, you cannot cast the spell on that target.
    "min_damage": 1,                                           // minimum number of creatures summoned (or "starting" number of creatures summoned)
    "max_damage": 1,                                           // maximum number of creatures summoned the spell can achieve
    "min_aoe": 3,                                            // area of effect of the spell, in this case the area the summons can appear in
    "max_aoe": 3,
    "effect": "summon",                                        // effects are coded in C++. A list is provided in this document of possible effects that have been coded.
    "effect_str": "mon_test_monster",                          // varies, see table of implemented effects in this document
    "min_duration": 6250,                                      // duration of spell effect (if the spell has a special effect)
    "max_duration": 6250
  }
  ```
2) Typical attack:
```
    {
    "id": "test_attack",                                     // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
    "type": "SPELL",
    "name": "Ranged Strike",                                 // name of the spell that shows in game
    "description": "Deals damage to the target with 100% accuracy. Will always apply the status effect specified in 'effect_str'.",
    "valid_targets": [ "ground", "hostile" ],                // if a valid target is not included, you cannot cast the spell on that target.
     "effect": "projectile_attack",                           // effects are coded in C++. A list is provided in this document of possible effects that have been coded.
    "effect_str": "stunned",                                 // varies, see table of implemented effects in this document
    "min_damage": 10,                                        // minimum damage (or "starting" damage)
    "max_damage": 20,                                        // maximum damage the spell can achieve
    "damage_increment": 1.0,                              // How much damage increases per spell level increase
    "min_range": 4,                                          // range of the spell
    "max_range": 4,
    "base_casting_time": 500,                                // this is the casting time (in moves)
    "min_duration": 200,                                     // duration of spell effect (if the spell has a special effect)
    "max_duration": 300,
    "duration_increment": 10,                              // How much longer the spell lasts per spell level
    "damage_type": "stab"                                    // type of damage
  } ;
  ```
  note: Uses both `ground` and `hostile` in `valid_targets` as well so it can be targeted in an area with no line of sight


3) Consecutively cast spells:
```
    {
    "id": "test_combo",                                        // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
    "type": "SPELL",
    "name": "Combo Strikes",                                   // name of the spell that shows in game
    "description": "Upon casting this spell, will also activate the spells specified on the 'extra_effects' in descending order.",
    "flags": [ "SILENT", "RANDOM_DAMAGE", "RANDOM_AOE" ],      // see "Spell Flags" in this document
    "valid_targets": [ "hostile", "ground" ],                  // if a valid target is not included, you cannot cast the spell on that target.
    "effect": "projectile_attack",                             // effects are coded in C++. A list is provided in this document of possible effects that have been coded.
    "effect_str": "downed",                                    // varies, see table of implemented effects in this document
    "extra_effects": [ { "id": "test_atk1" }, { "id": "test_atk2" } ],               // this allows you to cast multiple spells with only one spell
    "min_damage": 7,                                         // minimum damage (or "starting" damage)
    "max_damage": 14,                                        // maximum  damage the spell can achieve
    "damage_increment": 0.7                            // damage increase per spell level
    "min_aoe": 2,                                            // area of effect
    "max_aoe": 4,
    "aoe_increment": 0.2,                               // how much wider the area of effect gets per spell level
    "min_range": 10,                                         // range of the spell
    "max_range": 10,
    "base_casting_time": 750,                                // this is the casting time (in moves)
    "min_duration": 325,                                     // duration of spell effect (if the spell has a special effect)
    "max_duration": 325,
    "damage_type": "stab"                                    // type of damage
  } ;
  ```
  note: If you put two or more spells in `extra_effects`, it will simply cast all the spells consecutively - first spell in `extra_effects`, second in `extra_effects`, third in `extra_effects` and etc. if you wish to pick one randomly, use the `WONDER` flag. Additionally, the extra spells will be cast at a level up to the level of the parent spell being cast, unless additional data is added to the fake_spell.

4) Randomly cast spells:
```
  {
    "id": "test_starter_spell",                              // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
    "type": "SPELL",
    "name": "Starter",                                       // name of the spell that shows in game
    "description": "Upon casting this spell, randomly selects one spell specified in'extra_effects' to cast. This spell's damage counts how many times it will randomly select from the list",
    "flags": [ "SILENT", "WONDER", "RANDOM_DAMAGE" ],        // see "Spell Flags" in this document
    "valid_targets": [ "hostile" ],                          // if a valid target is not included, you cannot cast the spell on that target.
    "effect": "projectile_attack",                           // effects are coded in C++. A list is provided in this document of possible effects that have been coded.
    "extra_effects": [                                       // this allows you to cast multiple spells with only one spell
      { "id": "test_atk1" },                                 // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
      { "id": "test_atk2" },                                 // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
      { "id": "test_atk3" },                                 // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
      { "id": "test_atk4" },                                 // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
      { "id": "test_atk5" },                                 // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
      { "id": "test_atk6" }                                  // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
    ],
    "min_damage": 3,                                         // minimum damage (or "starting" damage)
    "max_damage": 5,                                         // maximum damage the spell can achieve
    "damage_increment": 0.2                            // damage increase per spell level
    "min_range": 10,                                         // range of the spell
    "max_range": 10
  }
  ```
  note: `WONDER` flag does wonders here, it works as a dice emulator. It picks one out of these spells (It cannot fail, it will always pick a minimum of one random spell), the amount of `rolls` of this dice are specified via `min_damage` and `max_damage` with the help of `RANDOM_DAMAGE` flag of course - in this example, this spell will be repeated minimum 3 times and maximum 5 times thus it will always be cast 3-5 times. There must be a minimum of one spell in `extra_effects` for wonder to work properly.

5) Repeatedly cast the same spell:
```
	{
    "type": "SPELL",
    "id": "test_attack_repeat",                         // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
    "name": "a spell",                                  // name of the spell that shows in game
    "description": "Upon casting this spell it will repeat the spell specified in `extra_effects` - the amount of repetitions is the interval `min_damage`-`max_damage` ",
    "extra_effects": [ { "id": "test_attack" } ],       // this allows you to cast multiple spells with only one spell
    "flags": [ "SILENT", "WONDER", "RANDOM_DAMAGE" ],   // see "Spell Flags" in this document
    "valid_targets": [ "hostile" ],                     // if a valid target is not included, you cannot cast the spell on that target.
    "effect": "target_attack",                          // effects are coded in C++. A list is provided in this document of possible effects that have been coded.
    "effect_str": "target_message",                     // varies, see table of implemented effects in this document
    "min_damage": 5,                                    // minimum (starting damage)
    "max_damage": 7,                                    // maximum damage the spell can achieve
    "damage_increment": 0.2                        // damage increase per spell level
    "min_range": 10,                                    // range of the spell
    "max_range": 10,
    "min_duration": 1,                                  // duration of spell effect (if the spell has a special effect)
    "max_duration": 1
  }
  ```
  note: Notice how we have `WONDER`, `RANDOM_DAMAGE` combo again - we have `min_damage` set to 5, `max_damage` set to 7. so that means that the `dice` will `roll` 5-7 times, but this time we have only one spell in `extra_effects`. observe that `WONDER` has a 100% chance of picking a spell if there is only 1 spell in `extra_effets`, thus it will repeat the same spell 5-7 times.

6) A spell that casts a note on a target and an effect on itself:
```
	{
    "id": "test_attack_note",                            // id of the spell, used internally. not translated
    "type": "SPELL",
    "name": "a note",                                    // name of the spell that shows in game
    "description": "This spell applies a harmless status effect to notify the player about the spell that the user has cast.",
    "flags": [ "SILENT" ],                               // see "Spell Flags" in this document
    "valid_targets": [ "hostile" ],                      // if a valid target is not included, you cannot cast the spell on that target.
    "effect": "target_attack",                           // effects are coded in C++. A list is provided in this document of possible effects that have been coded.
    "extra_effects": [ { "id": "sacrifice_spell", "hit_self": true }, { "id": "test_attack" } ],     // this allows you to cast multiple spells with only one spell
    "effect_str": "eff_test_note",                       // varies, see table of implemented effects in this document
	  "min_aoe": 6,                                       // area of effect (currently not implemented)
    "max_aoe": 6,
    "min_duration": 1,                                   // duration of spell effect (if the spell has a special effect)
    "max_duration": 1
  }
  ```
  note: Here we have to use one spell on the caster itself and the other on the hostile target. in order to make the caster cast a spell on itself - you must specify the `id` of whatever spell you're using and write near it in the same brackets `hit_self`: true, the second spell will be cast on the target
	This is necessary only if we need an effect that is cast on a target and a second effect that is cast on the caster.


#### Monsters

You can assign a spell as a special attack for a monster.

```json
{ "type": "spell", "spell_id": "burning_hands", "spell_level": 10, "cooldown": 10 }
```

* spell_id: the id for the spell being cast.
* spell_level: the level at which the spell is cast. Spells cast by monsters do not gain levels like player spells.
* cooldown: how often the monster can cast this spell
