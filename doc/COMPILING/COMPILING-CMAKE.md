# Prerequisites

You'll need to have these libraries and their development headers installed in order to build CataclysmDDA:

* General
  * `cmake`                     >= 3.0.0
  * `gcc-libs`
  * `glibc`
  * `zlib`
  * `bzip2`
* Optional
  * `gettext`
* Curses
  * `ncurses`
* Tiles
  * `SDL`                       >= 2.0.0
  * `SDL_image`                 >= 2.0.0 (with PNG and JPEG support)
  * `SDL_mixer`                 >= 2.0.0 (with Ogg Vorbis support)
  * `SDL_ttf`                   >= 2.0.0
  * `freetype`
* Sound
  * `vorbis`
  * `libbz2`
  * `libz`
  * `libintl`
  * `iconv`


# Build Environment

You can obtain the source code tarball for the latest version from [Github](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA).


## UNIX Environment

Obtain the packages listed above with your system package manager.


## Windows Environment (MSYS2)

1. Follow steps from here: <https://msys2.github.io/>
2. Install CataclysmDDA build deps:

   ```
   pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain msys/git \
   	  mingw-w64-i686-cmake \
   	  mingw-w64-i686-SDL2_{image,mixer,ttf} \
   	  ncurses-devel \
   	  gettext-devel
   ```

   This should get your environment set up to build both the console and tiles versions for Windows.

   **NOTE**: This is only for 32bit builds. 64bit builds require the x86_64 instead of the i686 packages listed above:

   ```
   pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain msys/git \
   	  mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake \
   	  mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_{image,mixer,ttf} \
   	  ncurses-devel \
   	  gettext-devel
   ```

   **NOTE**: If you're trying to test with Jetbrains CLion, point to the CMake version in the msys32/mingw32 path instead of using the built in. This will let CMake detect the installed packages.


# CMake Build

CMake has separate configuration and build steps. Configuration is done using CMake itself, and the actual build is done using either `make` (for Makefiles generator) or the build-system-agnostic `cmake --build . `.

There are two ways to build CataclysmDDA with CMake: inside the source tree or outside of it. Out-of-source builds have the advantage that you can have multiple builds with different options from one source directory.

**WARNING**: Inside the source tree build is **NOT** supported.

To build CataclysmDDA out of source:

```
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ make
```

The above example creates a build directory inside the source directory, but that's not required - you can just as easily create it in a completely different location.

To install CataclysmDDA after building (as root using su or sudo if necessary):

```
# make install
```

To change build options, you can either pass the options on the command line:

```
$ cmake .. -DOPTION_NAME=option_value
```

Or use either the `ccmake` or `cmake-gui` front-ends, which display all options and their cached values on a console UI or a graphical UI, respectively.

```
$ ccmake ..
$ cmake-gui ..
```


## CMake Build for MSYS2 (MinGW)

**NOTE**: For development purposes it is preferred to use `MinGW Win64 Shell` or `MinGW Win32 Shell` instead of `MSYS2 Shell`. In the other case, you will need to set the `PATH` variable manually.

For MinGW, MSYS, or MSYS2 you should set [Makefiles generator](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-generators.7.html) to "MSYS Makefiles". Setting it to "MinGW Makefiles" might work as well, but might also require some additional hackery.

Example:

```
$ cd <Path-to-CataclysmDDA-Sources>
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -G "MSYS Makefiles"
$ make  # or $ cmake --build .
```

The resulting binary will be placed inside the source code directory.

Shared libraries:

If you got a `libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll not found` error, you need to copy shared libraries to the directory with the CataclysmDDA executables.

**NOTE**: For `-DRELEASE=OFF` development builds, you can automate the copy process with:

```
$ make install
```

However, it will likely fail because you have a different build environment setup. :)

Currently known dependencies (may be outdated; use `ldd.exe` to correct it for your system):

* MINGW deps:
  * `libwinpthread-1.dll`
  * `libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll`
  * `libstdc++-6.dll`

* LOCALIZE deps:
  * `libintl-8.dll`
  * `libiconv-2.dll`

  * `libjbig-0.dll`
  * `liblzma-5.dll`
  * `libwebp-5.dll`
  * `zlib1.dll`
  * `libglib-2.0-0.dll`

## CMake Build for Visual Studio / MSBuild

CMake can generate  `.sln` and `.vcxproj` files used either by Visual Studio itself or by the MSBuild command line compiler (if you don't want a full fledged IDE) and have more "native" binaries than what MSYS/Cygwin can provide.

At the moment only a limited combination of options is supported (tiles only, no localizations, no backtrace).

### Get the tools

* CMake from the official site - https://cmake.org/download/.
* [Microsoft compiler](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=build+tools), choose "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017". When installing, choose the "Visual C++ Build Tools" options.
  * Alternatively, you can download and install the complete Visual Studio, but that's not required.

### Get the required libraries

* `SDL2` - <https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php> (you need the "(Visual C++ 32/64-bit)" version; same below)
* `SDL2_ttf` - <https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/>
* `SDL2_image` - <https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/>
* `SDL2_mixer` (optional, for sound support) - <https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/>
* Unsupported (and unused in the following instructions) optional libs:
  *  `gettext`/`libintl` - <http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gettext.htm>
  * `ncurses` - ???

### Unpack the archives with the libraries

Open the Windows command line (or powershell) and set the environment variables to point to the libs above as follows (adjusting the paths as appropriate):

```
> set SDL2DIR=C:\path\to\SDL2-devel-2.0.9-VC
> set SDL2TTFDIR=C:\path\to\SDL2_ttf-devel-2.0.15-VC
> set SDL2IMAGEDIR=C:\path\to\SDL2_image-devel-2.0.4-VC
> set SDL2MIXERDIR=C:\path\to\SDL2_mixer-devel-2.0.4-VC
```

(for powershell the syntax is `$env:SDL2DIR="C:\path\to\SDL2-devel-2.0.9-VC"`).

### Make a build directory and run CMake's configuration step

```
> cd <path to cdda sources>
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake .. -DTILES=ON -DLOCALIZE=OFF -DBACKTRACE=OFF -DSOUND=ON
```

### Build!

```
> cmake --build . -j 2 -- /p:Configuration=Release
```

The `-j 2` flag controls build parallelism - you can omit it if you wish. The `/p:Configuration=Release` flag is passed directly to MSBuild and controls optimizations. If you omit it, the `Debug` configuration would be built instead. For powershell you'll need to have an extra ` -- ` after the first one.

The resulting files will be put into a `Release` directory inside your source Cataclysm-DDA folder. To make them run you'd need to first move them to the source Cataclysm-DDA directory itself (so that the binary has access to the game data), and second put the required `.dll`s into the same folder - you can find those inside the directories for dev libraries under `lib/x86/` or `lib/x64/` (you likely need the `x86` ones even if you're on 64-bit machine).

The copying of dlls is a one-time task, but you'd need to move the binary out of `Release/` each time it's built. To automate it a bit, you can configure cmake and set the desired binary's destination directory with `-DCMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_RELEASE=`  option (and similar for `CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_DEBUG`).

Run the game. Should work.


# Build Options

For a full list of options supported by CMake, you may either run the `ccmake` or `cmake-gui` front-ends, or run `cmake` and open the generated `CMakeCache.txt` from the build directory in a text editor.

```
$ cmake -DOPTION_NAME1=option_value1 [-DOPTION_NAME2=option_value2 [...]]
```


## CMake-specific options

* `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<build type>`

  Selects a specific build configuration when compiling. `release` produces the default, optimized (`-Os`) build for regular use. `debug` produces a slower and larger unoptimized (`-O0`) build with full debug symbols, which is often needed for obtaining detailed backtraces when reporting bugs.

  **NOTE**: By default, CMake will produce `debug` builds unless a different configuration option is passed in the command line.


* `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<full path>`

  Installation prefix for binaries, resources, and documentation files.


## CataclysmDDA-specific options

 * `CURSES=<boolean>`: Build curses version.
 * `TILES=<boolean>`: Build graphical tileset version.
 * `SOUND=<boolean>`: Support for in-game sounds & music.
 * `USE_HOME_DIR=<boolean>`: Use user's home directory for save files.
 * `LOCALIZE=<boolean>`: Support for language localizations. Also enable UTF support.
 * `LANGUAGES=<str>`: Compile localization files for specified languages. Example:

   ```
   -DLANGUAGES="cs;de;el;es_AR;es_ES"
   ```

   Note that language files are only compiled automatically when building the `RELEASE` build type. For other build types, you need to add the `translations_compile` target to the `make` command: for example `make all translations_compile`.

   Special note for MinGW: Due to a [libintl bug](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?58006), using English without a `.mo` file causes significant slowdown on MinGW targets.  Make sure `en` is in the list provided to `-DLANGUAGES` (it is by default), in order to generate a `.mo` file for English.
 * `DYNAMIC_LINKING=<boolean>`: Use dynamic linking. Or use static to remove MinGW dependency instead.
 * `GIT_BINARY=<str>` Override the default Git binary name or path.

   So a CMake command for building Cataclysm-DDA in release mode with tiles and sound support will look as follows, provided it is run in the build directory located in the project.

   ```
   cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTILES=ON -DSOUND=ON
   ```
