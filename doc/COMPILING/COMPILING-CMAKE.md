#1. Prerequisites

You'll need to have these libraries and their development headers installed in
order to build CataclysmDDA:

 * General
   * `cmake`                     >= 3.0.0
   * `gcc-libs`
   * `glibc`
   * `zlib`
   * `bzip2`
 * Optional
   * `gettext`
 * Curses
   * `ncurses`
 * Tiles
   * `SDL`                       >= 2.0.0
   * `SDL_image`                 >= 2.0.0 (with PNG and JPEG support)
   * `SDL_mixer`                 >= 2.0.0 (with Ogg Vorbis support)
   * `SDL_ttf`                   >= 2.0.0
   * `freetype`
 * Sound
   * `vorbis`
   * `libbz2`
   * `libz`
   * `libintl`
   * `iconv`


#2. Build Environment

You can obtain the source code tarball for the latest version from [git](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA).


## UNIX Environment

Obtain packages specified above with your system package manager.


## Windows Environment (MSYS2)

 1. Follow steps from here: https://msys2.github.io/
 2. Install CataclysmDDA build deps:

 ```
	pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain msys/git \
		  mingw-w64-i686-cmake \
		  mingw-w64-i686-SDL2_{image,mixer,ttf} \
		  ncurses-devel \
		  gettext-devel
 ```

 This should get your environment set up to build console and tiles version of windows.

 **NOTE**: This is only for 32bit builds. 64bit requires the x86_64 instead of the i686
       packages listed above:

 ```
	pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain msys/git \
		  mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake \
		  mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_{image,mixer,ttf} \
		  ncurses-devel \
		  gettext-devel
 ```

 **NOTE**: If you're trying to test with Jetbrains CLion, point to the cmake version in the
       msys32/mingw32 path instead of using the built in. This will let cmake detect the
       installed packages.


# CMake Build

 CMake has separate configuration and build steps. Configuration
 is done using CMake itself, and the actual build is done using either `make`
 (for Makefiles generator) or build-system agnostic `cmake --build . ` .

 There are two ways to build CataclysmDDA with CMake: inside the source tree or
 outside of it. Out-of-source builds have the advantage that you can have
 multiple builds with different options from one source directory.

 **WARNING**: Inside the source tree build is **NOT** supported.

 To build CataclysmDDA out of source:

 ```
	$ mkdir build && cd build
	$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
	$ make
 ```

The above example creates a build directory inside the source directory, but that's not required - you can just as easily create it in a completely different location.

 To install CataclysmDDA after building (as root using su or sudo if necessary):

 ```
	# make install
 ```

 To change build options, you can either pass the options on the command line:

 ```
	$ cmake .. -DOPTION_NAME=option_value
 ```

 Or use either the `ccmake` or `cmake-gui` front-ends, which display all options
 and their cached values on a console and graphical UI, respectively.

 ```
	$ ccmake ..
	$ cmake-gui ..
 ```


## CMake Build for MSYS2 (MinGW)

 **NOTE**: For development purposes it is preferred to use `MinGW Win64 Shell` or `MinGW Win32 Shell` instead of `MSYS2 Shell`. In other case, you will need to set `PATH` variable manually.

 For Mingw,MSYS,MSYS2 you should set [Makefiles generator](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-generators.7.html) to "MSYS Makefiles".
 Setting it to "MinGW Makefiles" might work as well, but might also require additional hackery.

  Example:

 ```
	$ cd <Path-to-CataclysmDDA-Sources>
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake .. -G "MSYS Makefiles"
	$ make  # or $ cmake --build .
 ```

 The resulting binary will be placed inside the source code directory.

 Shared libraries:

 If you got `libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll not found` error you need to copy shared libraries
 to directory with CataclysmDDA executables.

 **NOTE**: For `-DRELEASE=OFF` development builds, You can automate copy process with:

 ```
	$ make install
 ```

 However, it likely will fail b/c you have different build environment setup :)

## CMake Build for Visual Studio / MSBuild

CMake can generate  `.sln` and `.vcxproj` files used either by Visual Studio itself or by MSBuild command line compiler (if you don't want
a full fledged IDE) and have more "native" binaries than what MSYS/Cygwin can provide.

At the moment only a limited combination of options is supported (tiles only, no localizations, no backtrace).

Get the tools:
  * CMake from the official site - https://cmake.org/download/.
  * Microsoft compiler - https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=build+tools , choose "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017". When installing chose "Visual C++ Build Tools" options.
    * alternatively, you can get download and install the complete Visual Studio, but that's not required.

Get the required libraries:
  * `SDL2` - https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php (you need the "(Visual C++ 32/64-bit)" version. Same below)
  * `SDL2_ttf` - https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
  * `SDL2_image` - https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
  * `SDL2_mixer` (optional, for sound support) - https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
  * Unsupported (and unused in the following instructions) optional libs:
    *  `gettext`/`libintl` - http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gettext.htm
    * `ncurses` - ???

Unpack the archives with the libraries.

Open windows command line (or powershell), set the environment variables to point to the libs above as follows (adjusting the paths as appropriate):
```
  > set SDL2DIR=C:\path\to\SDL2-devel-2.0.9-VC
  > set SDL2TTFDIR=C:\path\to\SDL2_ttf-devel-2.0.15-VC
  > set SDL2IMAGEDIR=C:\path\to\SDL2_image-devel-2.0.4-VC
  > set SDL2MIXERDIR=C:\path\to\SDL2_mixer-devel-2.0.4-VC
```
(for powershell the syntax is `$env:SDL2DIR="C:\path\to\SDL2-devel-2.0.9-VC"`).

Make a build directory and run cmake configuration step
```
  > cd <path to cdda sources>
  > mkdir build
  > cd build
  > cmake .. -DTILES=ON -DLOCALIZE=OFF -DBACKTRACE=OFF -DSOUND=ON
```


Build!
```
  > cmake --build . -j 2 -- /p:Configuration=Release
```
  The `-j 2` flag controls build parallelism - you can omit it if you wish. The `/p:Configuration=Release` flag is passed directly to MSBuild and
  controls optimizations. If you omit it, the `Debug` configuration would be built instead.  For powershell you'll need to have an extra ` -- ` after the first one.

The resulting files will be put into a `Release` directory inside your source Cataclysm-DDA folder. To make them run you'd need to first move them to the
source Cataclysm-DDA directory itself (so that the binary has access to the game data), and second put the required `.dll`s into the same folder -
you can find those inside the directories for dev libraries under `lib/x86/` or `lib/x64/` (you likely need the `x86` ones even if you're on 64-bit machine).

The copying of dlls is a one-time task, but you'd need to move the binary out of `Release/` each time it's built. To automate it a bit, you can configure cmake and set the desired binaries destination directory with `-DCMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_RELEASE=`  option (and similar for `CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_DEBUG`).

Run the game. Should work.


# Build Options

 A full list of options supported by CMake, you may either run the `ccmake`
 or `cmake-gui` front-ends, or run `cmake` and open the generated CMakeCache.txt
 from the build directory in a text editor.

 ```
	$ cmake -DOPTION_NAME1=option_value1 [-DOPTION_NAME2=option_value2 [...]]
 ```


## CMake specific options

 * CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=`<build type>`

 Selects a specific build configuration when compiling. `release` produces
 the default, optimized (-Os) build for regular use. `debug` produces a
 slower and larger unoptimized (-O0) build with full debug symbols, which is
 often needed for obtaining detailed backtraces when reporting bugs.

 **NOTE**: By default, CMake will produce `debug` builds unless a different
       configuration option is passed in the command line.


 * CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`<full path>`

 Installation prefix for binaries, resources, and documentation files.


## CataclysmDDA specific options

 * CURSES=`<boolean>`

 Build curses version.


 * TILES=`<boolean>`

 Build graphical tileset version.


 * SOUND=`<boolean>`

 Support for in-game sounds & music.


 * USE_HOME_DIR=`<boolean>`

 Use user's home directory for save files.


 * LOCALIZE=`<boolean>`

 Support for language localizations. Also enable UTF support.


 * DYNAMIC_LINKING=`<boolean>`

 Use dynamic linking. Or use static to remove MinGW dependency instead.


 * LANGUAGES=`<str>`

 Compile localization files for specified languages. Example:
 ```
 -DLANGUAGES="cs;de;el;es_AR;es_ES"
 ```

 * GIT_BINARY=`<str>`

 Override default Git binary name or path.

 So a CMake command for building Cataclysm-DDA in release mode with tiles and sound support will look as follows, provided it is run in build directory located in the project.
```
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTILES=ON -DSOUND=ON
```
