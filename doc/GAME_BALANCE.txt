Stat system scaling:
Minimum stat: 0 (should only happen due to penalties, instant failure in most scenarios)
Nominal stat: 8 ("average" person)
Very high stat: ? (realistic world class human)
Maximal stat: 20 (higher may be achievable, but we're not worried about balancing at that point.)

Skill system scaling:
Minimum skill: 0 (no training)
Maximum skill: 10 (requires regular training to maintain, "professional" level)

Monster melee skill scaling:
Minimum skill: 0 (no combat potential)
Nominal skill: 8 (average Zed)
Very high stat: 16 (skilled in combat)
Maximal stat: 20 (highest for balance purposes)

Dodge System assumptions:
Dodge chance is based on attacker's melee skill and target's dex stat and dodge skill.
Successful dodges negate the attack and impose a cumulative penalty on dodges within the same turn.

Dodge Use Cases:
An individual with no skill and nominal stats in ideal circumstances against a basic opponent should occasionally be able to dodge.

An individual with no skill and nominal stats in ideal circumstances against a skilled opponent should rarely if ever be able to dodge.

An individual with world-class dodging ability, in ideal circumstances against a basic opponent should have a negligible chance of failure.

An individual with world-class dodging ability, in ideal circumstances against a skilled opponent should have a moderate chance of failure.

The effect of increasing dodge skill has a growth rate with diminishing returns that accelerates sharply at the point where you move beyond the dodge a "regular" character is likely to achieve (7  and above)

The balance of melee versus dodge should favour dodge which, after all, isn't effective against a wide variety of other types of attacks.

Even a world class dodger should not be able to dodge continuously when attacked many times a turn.
