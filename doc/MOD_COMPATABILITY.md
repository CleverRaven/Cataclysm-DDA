# Mod Compatability

## Summary

Mods are capable of dynamically loading directories based on if other mods are loaded in the world.  This will prevent file contents within the mod_interactions folder from being read unless they are part of a folder named after a loaded mod's id.

## Guide

In order to dynamically load mod content, files must be placed within subdirectories named after other mod ids (capitalization is checked) within the mod_interactions folder.

Example:
Mod 1: Mind Over Matter (id:mindovermatter)
Mod 2: Xedra Evolved (id:xedra_evolved)

If Xedra wishes to load a file only when Mind Over Matter is active: mom_compat_data.json, it must be located as such:
Xedra_Evolved/mod_interactions/mindovermatter/mom_compat_data.json

Files located within the mod_interactions folders are always loaded after other mod content for every mod is loaded.

## Limitations

Individual mod interaction folders can only support a single mod to load / unload.  IE, a folder may be named "mindovermatter", it may not be named "mindovermatter,xedra_evolved" or some other variation.
