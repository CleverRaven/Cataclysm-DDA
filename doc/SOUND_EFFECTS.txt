Sound effects in the game. Each line describes a sound effect. The format is as follows:

id variant1|variant2

Where id describes the id of the sound effect, and a list of variants separated by | follows. When the variants are omitted, the variant "default" is assumed. Where the variants do not represent literal strings, but variables, they will be enclosed in < >. For instance, <furniture> is a placeholder for any valid furniture ID (as in the furniture definition JSON).

footstep default|light|clumsy|bionic
explosion default|small|huge
open_door <furniture>|<terrain>
close_door <furniture>|<terrain>
bash default
smash wall|door|door_boarded|glass
melee_hit <weapon> # note: use weapon id "null" for unarmed attacks
