### The Blob Questions

| Question | Answer | Last Update |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Can the player defeat the Blob? | No. The Blob has already won. It can't be killed, repelled, or otherwise negated. The Yrax have been working on this problem for millenia and will continue working on it for a much longer period of time. The Exodii don't have the idle time to think about winning, it takes all their energy just to keep gathering enough supplies and recruits to survive between jumps. | 06/15/2023 |
| Can the Blob infection be cured? | No. The infection is effectively everywhere on Earth, in every drop of water, in every living organism. | 06/15/2023 |

### Exodii Questions

| Question | Answer | Last Update |
| --- | ---| --- |
| Can I join the Exodii? | Not at this time, though they will continue to provide quests as the player's relationship with them improves. | 06/15/2023 |
| Why does Rubik talk like that? Why can't I talk to the quads? | Exodii are not a homogenous group with a single spoken language. Rubik happens to speak as close to modern English as any Exodii, though there are some phrases that don't translate well. | 06/15/2023 |
| What do the Exodii eat? | I_am_erk is working on an Exodii NPC who manages their gardens. They're interested in any seeds and samples that can be obtained, presumably cultivating robust crops. For obvious reasons, they likely ignore local game. | 07/19/2022 |

### Hub-01 Questions

| Question | Answer | Last Update |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Why are they showing as hostile? I didn't do anything to them! | This is a design issue, the faction should not accept outsiders in their base, and setting them to hostile allows them to shoot on sight while the Intercom can interact with the survivor normally. | 06/15/2023 |
