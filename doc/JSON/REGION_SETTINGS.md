# Region Settings

The **region_settings** define the attributes for map generation that apply to an entire region.
A region spans the entire game world but is handled on a per-overmap basis (see doc/JSON/OVERMAP.md).

The `region_settings` type has the following fields. 
NOTE: most of the below settings are stored in separate types and are referred to by id; 
see their info later in this document. 

### Fields

|       Identifier         |               Type                  |                            Description                                |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`                   |                                     | Type identifier. Must be "region_settings".                           |

### Example
```jsonc
{
    "type": "region_settings",
    "id": "default",
    "rivers": "default",
    "lakes": "default",
    "ocean": "default",
    "ravines": "default",
    "forests": "default",
    "forest_composition": "default",
    "forest_trails": "default",
    "highways": "default",
    "cities": "default",
    "map_extras": "default",
    "terrain_furniture": "default",
    "weather": "default",
    "default_oter": [
      "open_air",
      ...
    ],
    "default_groundcover": [ [ "t_region_groundcover", 1 ] ],
    "feature_flag_settings": { "blacklist": [  ], "whitelist": [  ] }
  },
```

# Region Overlay

Loading `region_settings` poses an issue: what if we only want to add a map extra to 
a set of regions instead of redefining the entire `region_settings` object? We can `copy-from`,
but if more than one mod is loaded, we would have multiple separate `region_settings` objects
but only one region available to use for the world.

We get around these issues by using a `region_overlay`.

A `region_overlay` is capable of extending the following types:
- `region_settings_city`
- `region_settings_highway`
- `region_settings_forest_trail`
- `region_settings_terrain_furniture`
- `region_settings_map_extras`*
- `region_settings_forest_composition`* 

NOTE: the types with asterisks have collections of other types that must 
be extended separately using "overlay_id". These types are:

- `map_extra_collection`
- `forest_biome`
- `forest_biome_component`

Study the below examples carefully; they are subtly different.

The following example will append city building "dinozoo" to all 
`region_settings_city` parks in all regions.

### Example
```jsonc
{
    "type": "region_overlay",
    "id": "default_dinomod",
	"apply_to_tags": [ "all" ],
    "cities": "default_dinomod"
},
{
    "type": "region_settings_city",
    "id": "default_dinomod",
    "parks": [ [ "dinozoo", 25 ] ]
}
```

The following example will append the map extra *collections* in "default_crazy" 
to map extra *collections* in all regions.
### Example
```jsonc
{
    "type": "region_overlay",
    "id": "default_crazy",
    "apply_to_tags": [ "all" ],
    "map_extras": "default_crazy"
},
{
    "type": "region_settings_map_extras",
    "id": "default_crazy",
    "extras": [ "forest_crazy" ]
},
{
    "type": "map_extra_collection",
    "id": "forest_crazy",
    "extras": [ [ "mx_shia", 1 ] ]
}
```

By adding "overlay_id": "forest" to the `map_extra_collection`, the above example would
extend `map_extra_collection` "id": "forest", spawning "mx_shia" along with the
other map extras in "forest".

### Example
```jsonc
{
    "type": "map_extra_collection",
    "id": "forest_crazy",
	"overlay_id": "forest",
    "extras": [ [ "mx_shia", 1 ] ]
}
```

### Tags

The "apply_to_tags" field will apply the overlay to any `region_settings` with
matching `tags`. Currently, using the tag "all" will apply the overlay to all regions:
```jsonc
{
    "apply_to_tags": [ "all" ],
}
```

If you wanted to apply the overlay only for regions with a "default" tag:
```jsonc
{
    "apply_to_tags": [ "default" ],
}
```

Tags are arbitary strings and are only used to avoid referencing a likely-growing number
of region_settings ids.

## Region Terrain / Furniture

**region_terrain_furniture** defines the resolution of regional terrain/furniture
(with flag REGION_PSEUDO) to their actual terrain and furniture types for the region, with a weighted list for
terrain/furniture entry that defines the relative weight of a given entry when mapgen resolves the
regional entry to an actual entry.

A list of all regional terrain/furniture can be found in:
data/json/furniture_and_terrain/furniture_regional_pseudo.json
data/json/furniture_and_terrain/terrain_regional_pseudo.json

Mod developers should define a mapping for every listed regional terrain/furniture;
they will be placed regardless of whether they're defined or not!

`region_terrain_furniture` contains the terrain/furniture id and the weighted lists they resolve to:
NOTE: only one of `ter_id` or `furn_id` and their respective lists can be used; terrain cannot map
to furniture and vice-versa.

| Identifier               |                            Description                                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ter_id`                 | Regional terrain id.                                                        |
| `replace_with_terrain`   | Weighted list of actual terrain replacing "ter_id".                         |
| `furn_id`                | Regional furniture id.                                                      |
| `replace_with_furniture` | Weighted list of actual furniture replacing "furn_id".                      |

### Example
```jsonc
{
    "type": "region_terrain_furniture",
    "id": "default_t_groundcover",
    "ter_id": "t_region_groundcover",
    "replace_with_terrain": [ [ "t_grass", 12000 ], [ "t_grass_dead", 2000 ], [ "t_dirt", 1000 ] ]
}
```

`region_settings_terrain_furniture` is simply a list of all `region_terrain_furniture`
mappings for the region:

### Fields

| Identifier  |                            Description                                      |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ter_furn`  | List of regional terrain/furniture and their corresponding weighted lists.  |

### Example
```jsonc
{
    "type": "region_settings_terrain_furniture",
    "id": "default",
    "ter_furn": [
      "default_t_groundcover",
      "default_t_groundcover_urban",
      "default_t_groundcover_forest",
	  ...
	]
}
```

## Region Lake Settings

**region_settings_lake** defines the attributes used in generating lakes on the
overmap. The actual placement of these features is determined globally across all overmaps so that
the edges of the features align, and these parameters are mostly about how those global features
are interpreted.

### Fields

|                 Identifier                 |                                 Description                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `noise_threshold_lake`                     | [0, 1], x > value spawns a `lake_surface` or `lake_shore`.                  |
| `lake_size_min`                            | Minimum size of the lake in overmap terrains for it to actually spawn.      |
| `lake_depth`                               | Depth of lakes, expressed in Z-levels (e.g. -1 to -10).                     |
| `shore_extendable_overmap_terrain`         | List of overmap terrains that can be extended to the shore if adjacent.     |
| `shore_extendable_overmap_terrain_aliases` | Overmap terrains to treat as different overmap terrain for extending shore. |

### Example

```jsonc
{
    "type": "region_settings_lake",
    "id": "default",
    "noise_threshold_lake": 0.25,
    "lake_size_min": 20,
    "lake_depth": -5,
    "shore_extendable_overmap_terrain": [ "forest", "forest_thick", "forest_water", "field" ],
    "shore_extendable_overmap_terrain_aliases": [
      { "om_terrain": "island_forest", "om_terrain_match_type": "TYPE", "alias": "forest" },
      { "om_terrain": "island_forest_thick", "om_terrain_match_type": "TYPE", "alias": "forest_thick" },
      { "om_terrain": "island_forest_water", "om_terrain_match_type": "TYPE", "alias": "forest_water" },
      { "om_terrain": "island_field", "om_terrain_match_type": "TYPE", "alias": "field" }
    ]
}
```

## Region Forest Settings

**region_settings_forest** defines the attributes used in *broadly* generating forest and swamps
on the overmap. The actual placement of these features is determined globally across all overmaps
so that the edges of the features align, and these parameters are mostly about how those global
features are interpreted.

### Fields

|               Identifier               |                              Description                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `noise_threshold_forest`               | [0, 1], x > value spawns `forest`.                                     |
| `noise_threshold_forest_thick`         | [0, 1], x > value spawns `forest_thick`.                               |
| `noise_threshold_swamp_adjacent_water` | [0, 1], x > value spawns `forest_water` if forest near a waterbody.    |
| `noise_threshold_swamp_isolated`       | [0, 1], x > value spawns `forest_water` if forest isolated from water. |
| `river_floodplain_buffer_distance_min` | Minimum buffer distance in overmap terrains for river floodplains.     |
| `river_floodplain_buffer_distance_max` | Maximum buffer distance in overmap terrains for river floodplains.     |

### Example

```jsonc
{
    "type": "region_settings_forest",
    "id": "default",
    "noise_threshold_forest": 0.2,
    "noise_threshold_forest_thick": 0.25,
    "noise_threshold_swamp_adjacent_water": 0.3,
    "noise_threshold_swamp_isolated": 0.6,
    "river_floodplain_buffer_distance_min": 3,
    "river_floodplain_buffer_distance_max": 15
}
```

## Region Forest Map Generation Settings

**region_settings_forest_mapgen** defines the attributes used in generating forest terrains, 
including their items, groundcover, terrain and furniture.

### Biomes

At the top level, `forest_mapgen_settings` is a collection of named configurations we
will call `forest_biome_mapgen` (not to be confused with regions; these are strictly for forests). 

It is possible to define settings for overmap terrains that are not rendered by the forest mapgen, 
but will be used when blending forest terrains with other terrain types.

```jsonc
{
    "type": "region_settings_forest_mapgen",
    "id": "default",
    "biomes": [ "biome_forest_default", "biome_forest_thick_default", "biome_forest_water_default" ]
  },
```

`forest_biome_mapgen` fields include:

### Fields

|          Identifier           |                                 Description                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `terrains`                    | The overmap terrain IDs which have this biome.                               |
| `sparseness_adjacency_factor` | Value relative to neighbors controls how dense the overmap terrain will be.  |
| `item_group`                  | Item group used to place items randomly within the overmap terrain.          |
| `item_group_chance`           | % chance, between 1 and 100, that an item will be placed.                    |
| `item_spawn_iterations`       | Number of times that the item spawning will be called.                       |
| `groundcover`                 | Weighted list of terrains used for base groundcover.                         |
| `components`                  | Collection of components that make up the terrains and furniture placed.     |
| `terrain_furniture`           | Collection of furniture conditionally placed based on terrain.               |

### Example

```jsonc
{
    "type": "forest_biome_mapgen",
    "id": "biome_forest_water_default",
    "terrains": [ "forest_water", "hunter_shack", "hunter_shack_1", "shipwreck_river_1", "shipwreck_river_2" ],
    "sparseness_adjacency_factor": 2,
    "item_group": "forest",
    "item_group_chance": 60,
    "item_spawn_iterations": 1,
    "groundcover": [ [ "t_region_groundcover_swamp", 1 ] ],
    "components": [ "trees_water", "flowers_and_shrubs_water", "clutter_water", "water_water" ],
    "terrain_furniture": { 
	  "t_water_murky": { 
	    "chance": 2, 
		"furniture": [ [ "f_region_water_plant", 1 ] ] 
		} 
	}
}
```

### Components

The "components" field of forest biomes (`forest_biome_component`) are a collection of named objects with a 
sequence, chance, and set of types that, during mapgen, are rolled in sequence to pick a feature to be 
placed at a given location. The names for the components are only relevant for the purposes of overriding 
them in region overlays.

### Fields

|  Identifier   |                             Description                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sequence`    | Sequence in which components are processed.                          |
| `chance`      | One in X chance that something from this component will be placed.   |
| `clear_types` | Clear all previously defined `types` for this component.             |
| `types`       | Weighted list of terrains and furniture that make up this component. |

### Example

```jsonc
{
    "type": "forest_biome_component",
    "id": "clutter_default",
    "sequence": 2,
    "chance": 80,
    "types": [
      [ "t_trunk", 128 ],
      [ "t_dirtmound", 128 ],
      [ "f_boulder_small", 128 ],
      [ "f_rubble_rock", 32 ],
      [ "f_boulder_medium", 8 ],
      [ "f_boulder_large", 1 ],
      [ "t_pit", 1 ],
      [ "t_pit_shallow", 1 ]
    ]
}
```

### Forest Biome Terrain-Conditional Furniture

Distinct from `region_settings_terrain_furniture`, the forest biome "terrain_furniture" field
picks furniture to place only on forest terrain. 
In the above biome example, "f_region_water_plant" is placed on "t_water_murky". 
NOTE: "f_region_water_plant" could be placed in the `components` section, 
but that would not guarantee its placement on "t_water_murky" only.

### Fields

|    Identifier     |                            Description                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `chance`          | One in X chance that furniture from this component will be placed. |
| `furniture`       | Weighted list of furniture that will be placed on this terrain.    |

## Region Forest Trail Settings

**region_settings_forest_trail** defines the attributes used in generating trails in the
forests, including their likelihood of spawning, their connectivity, their chance for spawning
trailheads, and some general tuning of the actual trail width/position in mapgen.

### Fields

|         Identifier         |                                         Description                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `chance`                   | One in X chance a contiguous forest will have a trail system.                               |
| `border_point_chance`      | One in X chance that the N/S/E/W-most point of the forest will be part of the trail system. |
| `minimum_forest_size`      | Minimum contiguous forest size before a trail system can be spawned.                        |
| `random_point_min`         | Minimum # of random points from contiguous forest used to form trail system.                |
| `random_point_max`         | Maximum # of random points from contiguous forest used to form trail system.                |
| `random_point_size_scalar` | Forest size is divided by this and added to the minimum number of random points.            |
| `trailhead_chance`         | One in X chance a trailhead will spawn at end of trail near field.                          |
| `trailhead_road_distance`  | Maximum distance trailhead can be from a road and still be created.                         |
| `trailheads`               | Weighted list of overmap specials / city buildings that will be placed as trailheads.       |

### Example

```jsonc
{
    "type": "region_settings_forest_trail",
    "id": "default",
    "chance": 2,
    "border_point_chance": 2,
    "minimum_forest_size": 100,
    "random_point_min": 4,
    "random_point_max": 50,
    "random_point_size_scalar": 100,
    "trailhead_chance": 1,
    "trailhead_road_distance": 6,
    "trailheads": { "trailhead_basic": 1, "trailhead_outhouse": 1, "trailhead_shack": 1 }
}
```

## Overmap Connection Settings

The **overmap_connection_settings** section defines the `overmap_connection_id`s used in hardcoded placement.

### Fields

    },
```

## Region City Settings

**region_settings_city** defines the possible overmap terrains and specials that may be used as
buildings in a city, their weighted chances of placement, and some attributes that control the
relative placements of various classes of buildings.

### Fields

|       Identifier        |                            Description                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `shop_radius`           | Radial frequency of shop placement. Smaller number = more shops.   |
| `park_radius`           | Radial frequency of park placement. Smaller number = more parks.   |
| `houses`                | Weighted list of overmap terrains and specials used for houses.    |
| `parks`                 | Weighted list of overmap terrains and specials used for parks.     |
| `shops`                 | Weighted list of overmap terrains and specials used for shops.     |

### Placing shops, parks, and houses

When picking a building to place in a given location, the game considers the city size, the
location's distance from the city center, and finally the `shop_radius` and `park_radius` values for
the region. It then tries to place a shop, then a park, and finally a house, where the chance to
place the shop or park are based on the formula `rng( 0, 99 ) > X_radius * distance from city center
/ city size`.

### Example
```jsonc
{
    "type": "region_settings_city",
    "id": "default",
    "shop_radius": 30,
    "shop_sigma": 50,
    "park_radius": 20,
    "park_sigma": 80,
	"houses": [
		["house_two_story_basement", 1],
		["house", 1000],
		["house_base", 333],
		["emptyresidentiallot", 20]
	],
	"parks": [
		["park", 4],
		["pool", 1]
	],
	"shops": [
		["s_gas", 5],
		["s_pharm", 3],
		["s_grocery", 15]
	]
}
```

## Region Map Extras
