Items are any entity in the game you can pick up; There are multiple `type`s of items, each having it's own unique fields; they are: 
- GENERIC - any item that is not one of the rest
- TOOL - can have tool qualities and use energy
- ARMOR - can define protection against incoming damage
- TOOL_ARMOR - combination of TOOL and ARMOR, for example for power armor
- GUN - shoots projectiles of any kind
- GUNMOD - is installed on a gun, if it has required slot
- AMMO - consumed by another tools or guns
- MAGAZINE - stores AMMO to be used in GUN, TOOL, GUNMOD or TOOLMOD; in this case item should have not a pocket of type MAGAZINE, but pocket of type MAGAZINE_WELL
- COMESTIBLE - can be eaten and can rot
- BOOK - can be read
- PET_ARMOR - defines pet armor
- BIONIC_ITEM - item is a CBM, if installed, you get the bionic effect with the same id as the item name
- TOOLMOD - this is a toolmod, and can be installed to modify tool in some way (mainly battery slot changes)
- ENGINE - defines the properties of a vehicle engine if installed in a transport
- WHEEL - defines the properties of a vehicle wheel if installed in a transport

### Generic Items

```C++
"type": "GENERIC",                // Defines this as some generic item
"id": "socks",                    // Unique ID. Must be one continuous word, use underscores if necessary
"name": {
    "ctxt": "clothing",           // Optional translation context. Useful when a string has multiple meanings that need to be translated differently in other languages.
    "str": "pair of socks",       // The name appearing in the examine box.  Can be more than one word separated by spaces
    "str_pl": "pairs of socks"    // Optional. If a name has an irregular plural form (i.e. cannot be formed by simply appending "s" to the singular form), then this should be specified. "str_pl" may also be needed if the unit test cannot determine if the correct plural form can be formed by simply appending "s". "str_sp" should be used instead of "str" or "str_pl" if the singular and plural forms are the same.

#### To hit object
For additional clarity, an item's `to_hit` bonus can be encoded as string of 4 fields.  All the fields are mandatory:

```C++
"to_hit": {
    "grip": "weapon",      // one of "bad", "none", "solid", or "weapon"
    "length": "hand",      // one of "hand", "short", or "long"
    "surface": "any",      // one of "point", "line", "any", or "every"
    "balance": "neutral"   // one of "clumsy", "uneven", "neutral", or "good"
}
```
See [GAME_BALANCE.md](/doc/design-balance-lore/GAME_BALANCE.md#to-hit-value)

### Ammo

```c++
{
  "id": "223",            // ID of the ammo
  "type": "AMMO",         // Defines this as ammo. It can use the same entries as a GENERIC item
                          // Additionally, some AMMO specific entries consist of the following:
  "ammo_type": "shot",    // Determines where the items can be loaded in. Requires a proper `"ammunition_type"` to be declared (see below). In this case, the `223` rounds can be loaded into magazines that accept `shot`-type ammo
  "damage": {             // Ranged damage when fired
    "damage_type": "bullet",  // Type of the damage that would be dealt
    "amount": 39,             // Amount of damage to be dealt
    "armor_penetration": 2,   // Flat armor penetration
    "barrels": [              // Replaces the `amount` when weapon has barrel length defined, allow to change the damage of the single round depending on the barrel length.
      { "barrel_length": "28 mm", "amount": 13 },  // If weapon has barrel lengh this or less, this amount of the damage would be applied
      { "barrel_length": "30 mm", "amount": 14 },
      { "barrel_length": "35 mm", "amount": 15 },
      { "barrel_length": "39 mm", "amount": 16 }
    ]
  },
  "range": 5,             // Range when fired
  "recovery_chance": 6,   // Percentage of chance to recover the ammo after firing
  "dispersion": 0,        // Inaccuracy of ammo, measured in 100ths of Minutes Of Angle (MOA)
  "shot_counter": 5,      // Increases amount of shots produced by gun by this amount. `"shot_counter": 5` means each shot will be counted as 6 shots (1 you actually perform + 5). Designed for using in suppressor mod breakage and for stuff like replaceable barrels, but not used anywhere at this moment
  "projectile_count": 5,  // Amount of pellets, that the ammo will shot, like in shotgun-like weapon. If used, `"shot_damage"` should be specified
  "shot_damage": { "damage_type": "bullet", "amount": 15 },  // (Optional) Specifies the damage caused by a single projectile fired from this round. If present, projectile_count must also be specified. Syntax is the same as `"damage"`
  "critical_multiplier": 4,  // If the hit is a critical hit, all ranged damage dealt will be multiplied by this
  "shot_spread": 100,     // (Optional) Specifies the additional dispersion of single projectiles. Only meaningful if shot_count is present.
  "recoil": 18,           // Recoil caused when firing. Roughly set to the projectile's muzzle energy in J, the same value the ammo's damage is derived from. See also the gun's min_cycle_recoil value
  "count": 25,            // Number of rounds that spawn together
  "stack_size": 50,       // (Optional) How many rounds are in the above-defined volume. If omitted, is the same as 'count'
  "show_stats": true,     // (Optional) Force stat display for combat ammo. (for projectiles lacking both damage and prop_damage)
  "loudness": 10,         // (Optional) Modifier that can increase or decrease base gun's noise when firing. If loudness value is not specified, then game calculates it automatically from ammo's range, damage, and armor penetration.
  "casing": "223_casing", // Casing of the ammo that would be left after shooting
  "effects": ["COOKOFF", "SHOT"]  // Ammo effcts, see below
},
```

Additionally, non-`"type": "AMMO"` items can be considered as ammo (capable of being shot, capable of being loaded into a `MAGAZINE` pocket), by adding the `ammo_data` field, which supports the same fields as the `AMMO` type. Do note that a proper `ammunition_type` is also required:

```c++
  {
    "id": "water_clean",
    "type": "COMESTIBLE",
    ...
    "ammo_data": { "ammo_type": "water", "damage": { "damage_type": "cold", "amount": 2 }, "range": 4 },
    ...
  },
  {
    "id": "water",
    "type": "ammunition_type",
    "name": "water",
    "default": "water"
  },
```


### Ammo Effects

ammo_effects define what effect the projectile, that you shoot, would have. List of existing ammo effects, **including hardcoded one**, can be found at `data/json/ammo_effects.json`

```c++
{
  "id": "AE_NULL",           // id of an effect

    "check_passable": false, // if false, projectile is able to penetrate impassable terrains, if penetration is defined (like walls and windows); if true, projectile can't penetrate even the sheet of glass; default false
    "check_sees": false,     // if false, field can be spawned behind the opaque wall (for example, behind the concrete wall); if true, it can't; default false
    "check_sees_radius": 0   // if "check_sees" is true, and this value is smaller than "radius", this value is used as radius instead. The purpose nor reasoning is unknown, probably some legacy of mininuke, so just don't use it; default 0
  },
  "trail": {                 // this field would be spawned across whole projectile path
    "field_type": "fd_fog",  // field, that would be spawned; defautl "fd_null"

  },
  "explosion": {             // explosion, that will happen at the tile that projectile hit
    "power": 0,              // mandatory; power of the explosion, in grams of tnt; pipebomb is about 300, grenade (without shrapnel) is 240
    "distance_factor": 0.8,  // how fast the explosion decay, closer to 1 mean lesser "power" loss per tile, 0.8 means 20% of power loss per tile; default 0.75, value should be bigger than 0, but lesser than 1
    "fire": false,           // explosion create a fire, related to it's power, distance and distance_factor
    "shrapnel": {            // explosion create a shrapnel, that deal the damage, calculated by gurney equasion
      "casing_mass": 0,      // total mass of casing, casing/power ratio determines fragment velocity.
      "fragment_mass": 0.0,  // Mass of each fragment in grams. Large fragments hit harder, small fragments hit more often.
      "recovery": 0,         // Percentage chance to drop an item at landing point.
      "drop": "null"         // Which item to drop at landing point
    }
  },
  "do_flashbang": false,     // Creates a one tile radius EMP explosion at the hit location; default false
  "do_emp_blast": false      // Creates a hardcoded flashbang explosion; default false
  "foamcrete_build": false   // Creates foamcrete fields and walls on the hit location, used in aftershock; default false
  "eoc": [ "EOC_CAUSE_PAIN", "EOC_CAUSE_VOMIT" ], // Runs EoC when hit the target. See EFFECT_ON_CONDITION.md#typical-alpha-and-beta-talkers-by-cases for more information
  "spell_data": { "id": "bear_trap" } // Spell, that would be casted when projectile hits an enemy
  "spell_data": { "id": "release_the_deltas", "hit_self": true, "min_level": 10 }, //another example
  "always_cast_spell ": false // if spell_data is used, and this is true, spell would be casted even if projectile did not deal any damage. Default false.
}
```

### Magazine

```C++
"type": "MAGAZINE",              // Defines this as a MAGAZINE
...                              // same entries as above for the generic item.
// Only MAGAZINE type items may define the following fields:
"ammo_type": [ "40", "357sig" ], // What types of ammo this magazine can be loaded with
"capacity" : 15,                 // Capacity of magazine (in equivalent units to ammo charges)

"default_ammo": "556",           // If specified override the default ammo (optionally set this for ammo belts)
"reload_time" : 100,             // How long it takes to load each unit of ammo into the magazine
"mag_jam_mult": 1.25             // Multiplier for gun mechanincal malfunctioning from magazine, mostly when it's damaged; Values lesser than 1 reflect better quality of the magazine, that jam less; bigger than 1 result in gun being more prone to malfunction and jam at lesser damage level; zero mag_jam_mult (and zero gun_jam_mult in a gun) would remove any chance for a gun to malfunction. Only works if gun has any fault from gun_mechanical_simple group presented; Jam chances are described in Character::handle_gun_damage(); at this moment it is roughly: 0.027% for undamaged magazine, 5% for 1 damage (|\), 24% for 2 damage (|.), 96% for 3 damage (\.), and 250% for 4 damage (XX), then this and gun values are summed up. Rule of thumb: helical mags should have 3, drum mags should have 2, the rest can be tweaked case by case, but mostly doesn't worth emulating it
"linkage" : "ammolink"           // If set one linkage (of given type) is dropped for each unit of ammo consumed (set for disintegrating ammo belts)
```


### Armor

Armor can be defined like this:

```C++
"type" : "ARMOR",                   // Defines this as armor
...                                 // same entries as above for the generic item.
                                    // additional some armor specific entries:
"covers" : [ "foot_l", "foot_r" ],  // Where it covers.  Use bodypart_id defined in body_parts.json
"warmth" : 10,                      //  (Optional, default = 0) How much warmth clothing provides
"environmental_protection" : 0,     //  (Optional, default = 0) How much environmental protection it affords
"encumbrance" : 0,                  // Base encumbrance (unfitted value)
"max_encumbrance" : 0,              // When a character is completely full of volume, the encumbrance of a non-rigid storage container will be set to this. Otherwise it'll be between the encumbrance and max_encumbrance following the equation: encumbrance + (max_encumbrance - encumbrance) * non-rigid volume / non-rigid capacity.  By default, max_encumbrance is encumbrance + (non-rigid volume / 250ml).
"sided": true,                      // (Optional, default false) If true, this is a sided armor. Sided armor is armor that even though it describes covering, both legs, both arms, both hands, etc. actually only covers one "side" at a time but can be moved back and forth between sides at will by the player.
"coverage": 80,                     // What percentage of body part is covered (in general)
"cover_melee": 60,                  // What percentage of body part is covered (against melee)
"cover_ranged": 45,                 // What percentage of body part is covered (against ranged)
"cover_vitals": 10,                 // What percentage of critical hit damage is mitigated
"material_thickness" : 1,           // Thickness of material, in millimeter units (approximately).  Ordinary clothes range from 0.1 to 0.5. Particularly rugged cloth may reach as high as 1-2mm, and armor or protective equipment can range as high as 10 or rarely more.
"power_armor" : false,              // If this is a power armor item (those are special).
"max_worn": 10,                     // How many of these items can be worn.  Defaults to 2.
"energy_shield_max_hp" : false,     // Determines the inital value for the `ENERGY_SHIELD_HP` and `ENERGY_SHIELD_MAX_HP` item variables used by energy shields. The field has no effect for armor pieces without the `ENERGY_SHIELD` flag.
"non_functional" : "destroyed",     //this is the itype_id of an item that this turns into when destroyed. Currently only works for ablative armor.
"damage_verb": "makes a crunch, something has shifted", // if an item uses non-functional this will be the description when it turns into its non functional variant.
"valid_mods" : ["steel_padded"],    // List of valid clothing mods. Note that if the clothing mod doesn't have "restricted" listed, this isn't needed.
"armor": [ ... ]
```

#### Armor Portion Data
Encumbrance and coverage can be defined on a piece of armor as such:

```c++
"armor": [
  {
    "encumbrance": [ 2, 8 ],
    "breathability": "AVERAGE",
    "layers": [ "SKINTIGHT" ],
    "rigid_layer_only": true,
    "coverage": 95,
    "cover_melee": 95,
    "cover_ranged": 50,
    "cover_vitals": 5,
    "covers": [ "torso" ],
    "specifically_covers": [ "torso_upper", "torso_neck", "torso_lower" ],
    "material": [
      { "type": "cotton", "covered_by_mat": 100, "thickness": 0.2 },
      { "type": "plastic", "covered_by_mat": 15, "thickness": 0.8, "ignore_sheet_thickness": "true" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "encumbrance": 2,
    "volume_encumber_modifier": 0.5,
    "coverage": 80,
    "cover_melee": 80,
    "cover_ranged": 70,
    "cover_vitals": 5,
    "activity_noise": { "volume": 8, "chance": 60 },
    "covers": [ "arm_r", "arm_l" ],
    "specifically_covers": [ "arm_shoulder_r", "arm_shoulder_l" ],
    "material": [
      { "type": "cotton", "covered_by_mat": 100, "thickness": 0.2 }
    ]
  }
]
```

##### Encumbrance
(integer, or array of 2 integers)
The value of this field (or, if it is an array, the first value in the array) is the base encumbrance (unfitted) of this item.
When specified as an array, the second value is the max encumbrance - when the pockets of this armor are completely full of items, the encumbrance of a non-rigid item will be set to this. Otherwise it'll be between the first value and the second value following this the equation: first value + (second value - first value) * non-rigid volume / non-rigid capacity.  By default, the max encumbrance is the encumbrance + (non-rigid volume / 250ml).
`volume_encumber_modifier` is the more modern way to do it is to set a scaling factor on the armor itself. This is much easier to read and quickly parse (not requiring mental math) and is a direct scaling on that 250ml constant. So if I set a "volume_encumber_modifier" of .25 it means that it's one additional encumbrance per 1000ml (250ml/.25).

##### Encumbrance_modifiers
Experimental feature for having an items encumbrance be generated by weight instead of a fixed number. Takes an array of "DESCRIPTORS" described in the code. If you don't need any descriptors put "NONE". This overrides encumbrance putting it as well will make it be ignored. Currently only works for head armor.

##### breathability

Overrides the armor breathability, which is driven by armor material. Can be `IMPERMEABLE` (0%), `POOR` (30%), `AVERAGE` (50%), `GOOD` (80%), `MOISTURE_WICKING` (110%), `SECOND_SKIN` (140%)

##### Layers

What layer this piece of armor occupy. Can be `PERSONAL`, `SKINTIGHT`, `NORMAL`, `WAIST`, `OUTER`, `BELTED`, `AURA`, see [ARMOR_BALANCE_AND_DESIGN.md#layers](/doc/design-balance-lore/ARMOR_BALANCE_AND_DESIGN.md#layers) for details

##### rigid_layer_only

If true, this armor portion is rigid, and conflict with another rigid clothes on the same layers.

##### Coverage
(integer)
What percentage of time this piece of armor will be hit (and thus used as armor) when an attack hits the body parts in `covers`.

`cover_melee` and `cover_ranged` represent the percentage of time this piece of armor will be hit by melee and ranged attacks respectively. Usually these would be the same as `coverage`.

`cover_vitals` represents the percentage of critical hit damage is absorbed. Only the excess damage on top of normal damage is mitigated, so a vital coverage value of 100 means that critical hits would do the same amount as normal hits.

##### Covers
(array of strings)
What body parts this section of the armor covers. See the bodypart_ids defined in body_parts.json for valid values.

##### Specifically Covers
(array of strings)
What sub body parts this section of the armor covers. See the sub_bodypart_ids defined in body_parts.json for valid values.
These are used for wearing multiple armor pieces on a single layer without gaining encumbrance penalties. They are not mandatory
if you don't specify them it is assumed that the section covers all the body parts it covers entirely.
strapped layer items, and outer layer armor should always have these specified otherwise it will conflict with other pieces.

##### Part Materials
(array of objects)
The type, coverage and thickness of the materials that make up this portion of the armor.
- `type` indicates the material ID.
- `covered_by_mat` (_optional_) indicates how much (%) of this armor portion is covered by said material. Defaults to 100.
- `thickness` (_optional_) indicates the thickness of said material for this armor portion. Defaults to 0.0.
The portion coverage and thickness determine how much the material contributes towards the armor's resistances.
**NOTE:** These material definitions do not replace the standard `"material"` tag. Instead they provide more granularity for controlling different armor resistances.
- `ignore_sheet_thickness` (_optional, default false_) materials that come in a specific thickness, if you don't use a multiple of the allowed thickness the game throws an error

`covered_by_mat` should not be confused with `coverage`. When specifying `covered_by_mat`, treat it like the `portion` field using percentage instead of a ratio value. For example:

```c++
"armor": [
  {
    "covers" : [ "arm_r", "arm_l" ],
    "material": [
      {
        "type": "cotton",
        "covered_by_mat": 100,
        "thickness": 0.2
      },
      {
        "type": "plastic",
        "covered_by_mat": 15,
        "thickness": 0.6
      }
    ],
    ...
  }
]
```
The case above describes a portion of armor that covers the arms. This portion is 100% covered by cotton, so a hit to the arm part of the armor will definitely impact the cotton. That portion is also 15% covered by plastic. This means that during damage absorption, the cotton material contributes 100% of its damage absorption, while the plastic material only contributes 15% of its damage absorption. Damage absorption is also affected by `thickness`, so thickness and material cover both provide positive effects for protection.

##### Armor Data
Alternately, every item (book, tool, gun, even food) can be used as armor if it has armor_data:
```C++
"type" : "TOOL",      // Or any other item type
...                   // same entries as for the type (e.g. same entries as for any tool),
"armor_data" : {      // additionally the same armor data like above
    "warmth" : 10,
    "environmental_protection" : 0,
    "armor": [
      {
        "material": [
          { "type": "cotton", "covered_by_mat": 100, "thickness": 0.2 },
          { "type": "plastic", "covered_by_mat": 15, "thickness": 0.6 }
        ],
        "covers" : [ "foot_l", "foot_r" ],
        "encumbrance" : 0,
        "coverage" : 80,
        "cover_melee": 80,
        "cover_ranged": 70,
        "cover_vitals": 5
      }
    ],
    "power_armor" : false
}
```
#### Guidelines for thickness: ####
According to <https://propercloth.com/reference/fabric-thickness-weight/>, dress shirts and similar fine clothing range from 0.15mm to 0.35mm.
According to <https://leathersupreme.com/leather-hide-thickness-in-leather-jackets/>:
* Fashion leather clothes such as thin leather jackets, skirts, and thin vests are 1.0mm or less.
* Heavy leather clothes such as motorcycle suits average 1.5mm.

From [this site](https://cci.one/site/marine/design-tips-fabrication-overview/tables-of-weights-and-measures/), an equivalency guideline for fabric weight to mm:

| Cloth                         | oz/yd2 | g/m2  | Inches | mm   |
| -----                         | ------ | ----- | ------ | ---- |
| Fiberglass (plain weave)      |    2.3 |    78 |  0.004 | 0.10 |
| Fiberglass (plain weave)      |    6.0 |   203 |  0.007 | 0.17 |
| Kevlar (TM) (plain weave)     |    5.0 |   170 |  0.010 | 0.25 |
| Carbon Fiber (plain weave)    |    5.8 |   197 |  0.009 | 0.23 |
| Carbon Fiber (unidirectional) |    9.0 |   305 |  0.011 | 0.28 |

Chart cobbled together from several sources for more general materials:

| Fabric     | oz/yd2  | Max g/m2   | Inches      | mm to use  |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Very light |     0-4 |        136 | 0.006-0.007 |       0.15 |
| Light      |     4-7 |        237 |       0.008 |        0.2 |
| Medium     |    7-11 |        373 | 0.009-0.011 |       0.25 |
| Heavy      |   11-14 |        475 | 0.012-0.014 |        0.3 |

Shoe thicknesses are outlined at <https://secretcobbler.com/choosing-leather/>; TL;DR: upper 1.2 - 2.0mm, lining 0.8 - 1.2mm, for a total of 2.0 - 3.2mm.

#### Armor inheritance

Inheritance of one armor using another allows to copy all its values, including layers, thicknesses, and another. Additionally, the `replace_materials` could be used to replace one material in parent armor to another material in child node, in format `"replace_materials": { "material_1": "material_2" }`. For example: 
```c++
{
  "id": "skeleton_plate",
  "type": "TOOL_ARMOR",
  "copy-from": "armor_lc_plate",
  "name": { "str": "skeletal plate" },
  "description": "A full body multilayered suit of skeletal plate armor.",
  "replace_materials": { "lc_steel": "bone", "lc_steel_chain": "flesh" },
  "extend": { "flags": [ "INTEGRATED", "UNBREAKABLE", "NO_SALVAGE" ] },
  "proportional": { "encumbrance": 0.3 }
}
```
In this json, the item inherited all stats of `armor_lc_plate`, but replaced `lc_steel` material with `bone`, and `lc_steel_chain` with `flesh`. Multiple additional flags were added using `extend`, and encumbrance was `proportional`ly decreased to 30% of original.

### Pet Armor
Pet armor can be defined like this:

```C++
"type" : "PET_ARMOR",     // Defines this as armor
...                   // same entries as above for the generic item.
                      // additional some armor specific entries:
"environmental_protection" : 0,  //  (Optional, default = 0) How much environmental protection it affords
"material_thickness" : 1,  // Thickness of material, in millimeter units (approximately).  Generally ranges between 1 - 5, more unusual armor types go up to 10 or more
"pet_bodytype":        // the body type of the pet that this monster will fit. See MONSTERS.md
"max_pet_vol":          // the maximum volume of the pet that will fit into this armor. Volume in ml or L can be used - "50 ml" or "2 L".
"min_pet_vol":          // the minimum volume of the pet that will fit into this armor. Volume in ml or L can be used - "50 ml" or "2 L".
"power_armor" : false, // If this is a power armor item (those are special).
```
Alternately, every item (book, tool, gun, even food) can be used as armor if it has armor_data:
```C++
"type" : "TOOL",      // Or any other item type
...                   // same entries as for the type (e.g. same entries as for any tool),
"pet_armor_data" : {      // additionally the same armor data like above
    "environmental_protection" : 0,
    "pet_bodytype": "dog",
    "max_pet_vol": "35000 ml",
    "min_pet_vol": "25000 ml",
    "material_thickness" : 1,
    "power_armor" : false
}
```

### Books

Books can be defined like this:

```C++
"type" : "BOOK",      // Defines this as a BOOK
...                   // same entries as above for the generic item.
                      // additional some book specific entries:
"max_level" : 5,      // Maximum skill level this book will train to
"intelligence" : 11,  // Intelligence required to read this book without penalty
"time" : "35 m",      // Time a single read session takes. An integer will be read in minutes or a time string can be used.
"fun" : -2,           // Morale bonus/penalty for reading
"skill" : "computer", // Skill raised
"chapters" : 4,       // Number of chapters (for fun only books), each reading "consumes" a chapter. Books with no chapters left are less fun (because the content is already known to the character).
"generic": false,     // This book counts chapters by item instance instead of by type (this book represents a generic variety of books, like "book of essays")
"required_level" : 2,  // Minimum skill level required to learn
"martial_art": "style_mma", // Martial art learned from this book; incompatible with `skill`
"proficiencies": [    // Having this book mitigate lack of proficiency, required for crafting 
  { 
    "proficiency": "prof_fermenting", // id of proficiency
    "time_factor": 0.1,               // slowdown for using this book proficiency - slowdown from lack of proficiency is multiplied on this value, so for `0.75`, if recipe adds 10 hours for lack of proficiency,  with book it would be [ 10 * ( 1 - 0.75 ) = ] 2.5 hours; multiple books stacks, but in logarithmic way, meaning having more books of the same proficiency is better than having one book, but never would be better than learning the proficiency
    "fail_factor": 0.25               // works same as `time_factor`
  },
  { "proficiency": "prof_brewing", "time_factor": 0.25, "fail_factor": 0.5 },
  { "proficiency": "prof_winemaking", "time_factor": 0.1, "fail_factor": 0.25 }
],

```
It is possible to omit the `max_level` field if the book you're creating contains only recipes and it's not supposed to level up any skill. In this case the `skill` field will just refer to the skill required to learn the recipes.

Alternately, every item (tool, gun, even food) can be used as book if it has book_data:
```C++
"type" : "TOOL",      // Or any other item type
...                   // same entries as for the type (e.g. same entries as for any tool),
"book_data" : {       // additionally the same book data like above
    "max_level" : 5,
    "intelligence" : 11,
    "time" : 35,
    "fun" : -2,
    "skill" : "computer",
    "chapters" : 4,
    "use_action" : "MA_MANUAL", // The book_data can have use functions (see USE ACTIONS) that are triggered when the books has been read. These functions are not triggered by simply activating the item (like tools would).
    "required_level" : 2
}
```

Since many book names are proper names, it's often necessary to explicitly specify
the plural forms. The following is the game's convention on plural names of books:

1. For non-periodical books (textbooks, manuals, spellbooks, etc.),
    1. If the book's singular name is a proper name, then the plural name is `copies of (singular name)`. For example, the plural name of `Lessons for the Novice Bowhunter` is `copies of Lessons for the Novice Bowhunter`.
    2. Otherwise, the plural name is the usual plural of the singular name. For example, the plural name of `tactical baton defense manual` is `tactical baton defense manuals`
2. For periodicals (magazines and journals),
    1. If the periodical's singular name is a proper name, and doesn't end with "Magazine", "Weekly", "Monthly", etc., the plural name is `issues of (singular name)`. For example, the plural name of `Archery for Kids` is `issues of Archery for Kids`.
    2. Otherwise, the periodical's plural name is the usual plural of the singular name. For example, the plural name of `Crafty Crafter's Quarterly` is `Crafty Crafter's Quarterlies`.
3. For board games (represented internally as book items),
    1. If the board game's singular name is a proper name, the plural is `sets of (singular name)`. For example, the plural name of `Picturesque` is `sets of Picturesque`.
    2. Otherwise the plural name is the usual plural. For example, the plural of `deck of cards` is `decks of cards`.

#### Conditional Naming

The `conditional_names` field allows defining alternate names for items that will be displayed instead of (or in addition to) the default name, when specific conditions are met. Take the following (incomplete) definition for `sausage` as an example of the syntax:

```c++
{
  "name": "sausage",
  "conditional_names": [
    {
      "type": "FLAG",
      "condition": "CANNIBALISM",
      "name": "Mannwurst"
    },
    {
      "type": "COMPONENT_ID_SUBSTRING",
      "condition": "mutant",
      "name": { "str_sp": "sinister %s" }
    },
    {
      "type": "COMPONENT_ID",
      "condition": "mutant",
      "name": { "str_sp": "sinister %s" }
    },
    {
      "type": "VAR",
      "condition": "DISPLAY_NAME_MORALE",
      "name": { "str_sp": "%s (morale)" },
      "value" : "true"
    },
    {
      "type": "SNIPPET_ID",
      "condition": "test",
      "value":"one",
      "name": { "str_sp": "Report 1" } }
  ]
}
```

You can list as many conditional names for a given item as you want. Each conditional name must consist of 3 elements:
1. The condition type:
    - `COMPONENT_ID_SUBSTRING` searches all the components of the item (and all of *their* components, and so on) for an item with the condition string in their ID. The ID only needs to *contain* the condition, not match it perfectly (though it is case sensitive). For example, supplying a condition `mutant` would match `mutant_meat`.
    - `COMPONENT_ID` Similar to `COMPONENT_ID_SUBSTRING`, but search the exact component match
    - `FLAG` which checks if an item has the specified flag (exact match).
    - `VITAMIN` which checks if an item has the specified vitamin (exact match).
    - `VAR` which checks if an item has a variable with the given name (exact match) and value = `value`.
    - `SNIPPET_ID`which checks if an item has a snippet id variable set by an effect_on_condition with the given name (exact match) and snippets id = `value`.
2. The condition you want to look for.
3. The name to use if a match is found. Follows all the rules of a standard `name` field, with valid keys being `str`, `str_pl`, and `ctxt`. You may use %s here, which will be replaced by the name of the item. Conditional names defined prior to this one are taken into account.

So, in the above example, if the sausage is made from mutant humanoid meat, and therefore both has the `CANNIBALISM` flag, *and* has a component with `mutant` in its ID:
1. First, the item name is entirely replaced with "Mannwurst" if singular, or "Mannwursts" if plural.
2. Next, it is replaced by "sinister %s", but %s is replaced with the name as it was before this step, resulting in "sinister Mannwurst" or "sinister Mannwursts".

NB: If `"str": "sinister %s"` was specified instead of `"str_sp": "sinister %s"`, the plural form would be automatically created as "sinister %ss", which would become "sinister Mannwurstss" which is of course one S too far. Rule of thumb: If you are using %s in the name, always specify an identical plural form unless you know exactly what you're doing!


#### Color Key

When adding a new book, please use this color key:

* Magazines: `pink`
* “Paperbacks” Short enjoyment books (including novels): `light_cyan`
* “Hardbacks” Long enjoyment books (including novels): `light_blue`
* “Small textbook” Beginner level textbooks, guides and martial arts books: `green`
* “Large textbook” Advanced level textbooks and advanced guides: `blue`
* Religious books: `dark_gray`
* “Printouts” (including spiral-bound, binders, and similar) Technical documents, (technical?) protocols, (lab) journals, personal diaries: `light_green`
* Other reading material/non-books (use only if every other category does not apply): `light_gray`

A few exceptions to this color key may apply, for example for books that don’t are what they seem to be.
Never use `yellow` and `red`, those colors are reserved for sounds and infrared vision.

#### CBMs

CBMs can be defined like this:

```C++

Vitamins specified by weight can be in grams ("g"), milligrams ("mg") or micrograms ("μg", "ug", "mcg").  If a vitamin is not specified by weight, it is specified in "units", with meaning according to the vitamin definition.

"petfood": [ "FUNGALFRUIT", "MIGOFOOD" ] // (Optional) Pet food categories this item is in.
```


### Containers

Any Item can be a container. To add the ability to contain things to an item, you need to add pocket_data. The below example is a typical container (shown with optional default values, or mandatory if the value is mandatory)

```C++
"pocket_data": [
  {
    "pocket_type": "CONTAINER",       // Typical container pocket. Pockets can also be MAGAZINE.
    "max_contains_volume": mandatory, // Maximum volume this pocket can hold, totaled among all contained items.  For example "2 L" or "2000 ml" would hold two liters of items.
    "max_contains_weight": mandatory, // Maximum weight this pocket can hold, totaled among all container items.  For example "6 kg" is about enough to contain a bowling ball.
    "min_item_volume": "0 ml",        // Minimum volume of item that can be placed into this pocket.  Items smaller than this cannot be placed in the pocket.
    "max_item_volume": "0 ml",        // Maximum volume of item that can fit through the opening into this pocket.  For example, a 2-liter bottle has a "17 ml" opening.
    "max_item_length": "0 mm",        // Maximum length of items that can fit in this pocket, by their longest_side.  Default is the diagonal opening length assuming volume is a cube (cube_root(vol)*square_root(2))
    "min_item_length": "0 mm",        // Minimum length of the item that can fit int this pocket
    "spoil_multiplier": 1.0,          // How putting an item in this pocket affects spoilage.  Less than 1.0 and the item will be preserved longer; 0.0 will preserve indefinitely.
    "weight_multiplier": 1.0,         // The items in this pocket magically weigh less inside than outside.  Nothing in vanilla should have a weight_multiplier.
    "volume_multiplier": 1.0,         // The items in this pocket have less volume inside than outside.  Can be used for containers that'd help in organizing specific contents, such as cardboard rolls for duct tape.
    "volume_encumber_modifier": 1,    // Default 1. How much this pocket contributes to enumbrance compared to an average item; Works same as volume_encumber_modifier from armor data, see JSON_INFO.md#armor-portion-data
    "moves": 100,                     // Indicates the number of moves it takes to remove an item from this pocket, assuming best conditions.
    "rigid": false,                   // Default false. If true, this pocket's size is fixed, and does not expand when filled.  A glass jar would be rigid, while a plastic bag is not.
    "forbidden": true,                // Default false. If true, this pocket cannot be used by players. 
    "magazine_well": "0 ml",          // Amount of space you can put items in the pocket before it starts expanding.  Only works if rigid = false.
    "watertight": false,              // Default false. If true, can contain liquid.
    "airtight": false,                // Default false. If true, can contain gas.
    "ablative": false,                // Default false. If true, this item holds a single ablative plate. Make sure to include a flag_restriction on the type of plate that can be added.
    "holster": false,                 // Default false. If true, only one stack of items can be placed inside this pocket, or one item if that item is not count_by_charges.
    "open_container": false,          // Default false. If true, the contents of this pocket will spill if this item is worn by a character or placed into another item.
    "fire_protection": false,         // Default false. If true, the pocket protects the contained items from exploding if tossed into a fire.
    "transparent": false              // Default false. If true, the pocket is transparent, as you can see items inside it afar; in the future this would be used for light also
    "extra_encumbrance": 3,           // Additional encumbrance given to character, if this pocket is used
    "ripoff": 3,                      // Default 0, as can't be ripped; Chance this pockets contents get ripped off when escaping a grab - random number between 0 and strength of the grab (20 for generic zed, for example) against random number between 0 and ten times of ripoff
    "activity_noise": {               // Define the noise generated, if you walk, and this container is not empty 
        "volume": 8,                  // How loud the noise would be
        "chance": 60                  // Chance to generate a noise per move, from 0 to 100
      }, 
    "default_magazine": "medium_battery_cell", // Define the default magazine this item would have when spawned. Can be overwritten by item group
    "ammo_restriction": { "ammotype": count }, // Restrict pocket to a given ammo type and count.  This overrides mandatory volume, weight, watertight and airtight to use the given ammo type instead.  A pocket can contain any number of unique ammo types each with different counts, and the container will only hold one type (as of now).  If this is left out, it will be empty.
    "flag_restriction": [ "FLAG1", "FLAG2" ],  // Items can only be placed into this pocket if they have a flag that matches one of these flags.
    "item_restriction": [ "item_id" ],         // Only these item IDs can be placed into this pocket. Overrides ammo and flag restrictions.
    "material_restriction": [ "material_id" ], // Only items that are mainly made of this material can enter.
	// If multiple of "flag_restriction", "material_restriction" and "item_restriction" are used simultaneously then any item that matches any of them will be accepted.

    "sealed_data": { "spoil_multiplier": 0.0 } // If a pocket has sealed_data, it will be sealed when the item spawns.  The sealed version of the pocket will override the unsealed version of the same datatype.

    "inherits_flags": true // Items in this pocket pass their flags to the parent item.
  }
]
```

### Melee

  "balance": "neutral"                       
}
```
### Memory Cards

Memory card information can be defined on any GENERIC item by adding an object named `memory_card`, this field does not support `extend`/`remove`, only override.

```C++
"id": "memory_card_unread",
"name": "memory card (unread)",
// ...
"memory_card": {
  "data_chance": 0.5,                  // 50% chance to contain data
  "on_read_convert_to": "memory_card", // converted to this itype_id on read

  "secret_recipes": true               // (Optional) Boolean, default false. If true, can contain recipes with the `SECRET` flag.
}
```

### Gun

Guns can be defined like this:

```C++
"type": "GUN",             // Defines this as a GUN
...                        // same entries as above for the generic item.
                           // additional some gun specific entries:
"skill": "pistol",         // Skill used for firing
"ammo": [ "357", "38" ],   // Ammo types accepted for reloading
"ranged_damage": 0,        // Ranged damage when fired (see #ammo)
"range": 0,                // Range when fired
"dispersion": 32,          // Inaccuracy of gun, measured in 100ths of Minutes Of Angle (MOA)
// When sight_dispersion and aim_speed are present in a gun mod, the aiming system picks the "best"
// sight to use for each aim action, which is the fastest sight with a dispersion under the current
// aim threshold.
"min_strength": 8,         // Minimal strength required to use this gun. Mostly used in different bows
"sight_dispersion": 10,    // Inaccuracy of gun derived from the sight mechanism, measured in 100ths of Minutes Of Angle (MOA)
"recoil": 0,               // Recoil caused when firing, measured in 100ths of Minutes Of Angle (MOA)
"durability": 8,           // Resistance to damage/rusting, also determines misfire chance
"gun_jam_mult": 1.25       // Multiplier for gun mechanincal malfunctioning, mostly when it's damaged; Values lesser than 1 reflect better quality of the gun, that jam less; bigger than 1 result in gun being more prone to malfunction and jam at lesser damage level; zero gun_jam_mult (and zero mag_jam_mult if magazine is presented) would remove any chance for a gun to malfunction. Only apply if gun has any fault from gun_mechanical_simple group presented; Jam chances are described in Character::handle_gun_damage(); at this moment it is roughly: 0.05% for undamaged gun, 3% for 1 damage (|\), 15% for 2 damage (|.), 45% for 3 damage (\.), and 80% for 4 damage (XX), then this and magazine values are summed up
"blackpowder_tolerance": 8,// One in X chance to get clogged up (per shot) when firing blackpowder ammunition (higher is better). Optional, default is 8.
"min_cycle_recoil": 0,     // Minimum ammo recoil for the gun to be able to fire more than once per attack (to cycle), else shooting it results in a cycling failure. Set at 90% of the base ammo recoil, or 75% of the value if the weapon is known to cycle with blackpowder. This is to prevent the weapon from cycling with any kind of ammo
"clip_size": 100,          // Maximum amount of ammo that can be loaded
"faults": [ "fault_gun_dirt", "fault_gun_chamber_spent" ], // Type of faults, that can be applied to this gun; usually are inherited from single abstract like rifle_base, but exceptions exist
"handling": 10             // handling of the weapon; better handling means less recoil
"energy_drain": "2 kJ",    // Additionally to the normal ammo (if any), a gun can require some electric energy. Drains from battery in gun. Use flags "USE_UPS" and "USES_BIONIC_POWER" to drain other sources. This also works on mods. Attaching a mod with energy_drain will add/increase drain on the weapon.
"heat_per_shot": 10,       // Each shot from this weapon adds this amount of heat
"cooling_value": 3,        // Amount of heat value, that is reduced every turn
"overheat_threshold": 100, // Heat value, at which fault may occur, see #Item faults; values below zero mean item won't be able to fault
"ammo_to_fire" 1,          // Amount of ammo used
"modes": [ [ "DEFAULT", "semi-auto", 1 ], [ "AUTO", "auto", 4 ] ], // Firing modes on this gun, DEFAULT,AUTO, or MELEE followed by the name of the mode displayed in game, and finally the number of shots of the mod.
"reload": 450,             // Amount of time to reload, 100 = 1 second = 1 "turn"
"reload_noise": "Ping!",   // Sound, that would be produced, when the gun is reloaded; seems to not work
"reload_noise_volume": 4,  // how loud the reloading is
"built_in_mods": ["m203"], //An array of mods that will be integrated in the weapon using the IRREMOVABLE tag.
"default_mods": ["m203"]   //An array of mods that will be added to a weapon on spawn.
"barrel_volume": "30 mL",  // Amount of volume lost when the barrel is sawn. Approximately 250 ml per inch is a decent approximation.
"valid_mod_locations": [ [ "brass catcher", 1 ], [ "grip", 1 ] ],  // The valid locations for gunmods and the mount of slots for that location.
"loudness": 10             // Amount of noise produced by this gun when firing. If no value is defined, then it's calculated based on loudness value from loaded ammo. Final loudness is calculated as gun loudness + gunmod loudness + ammo loudness. If final loudness is 0, then the gun is completely silent.
```
Alternately, every item (book, tool, armor, even food) can be used as gun if it has gun_data:
```c++
"type": "TOOL",      // Or any other item type
...                   // same entries as for the type (e.g. same entries as for any tool),
"gun_data" : {        // additionally the same gun data like above
    "skill": ...,
    "recoil": ...,
    ...
}
```

### Gunmod

Gun mods can be defined like this:

```C++
"type": "GUNMOD",              // Defines this as a GUNMOD
...                            // Same entries as above for the generic item.
                               // Additionally some gunmod specific entries:
// Only GUNMOD type items may define the following fields:
"location": "stock",           // Mandatory. Where is this gunmod is installed?
"mod_targets": [ "crossbow" ], // Mandatory. What kind of weapons can this gunmod be used with?
"install_time": "30 s",        // Mandatory. How long does installation take? An integer will be read as moves or a time string can be used.

"reload_noise": "chuk chuk.",   // Message, that would be produced when you reload a gun with this mod; Seems to not work 
"reload_noise_volume": 2,       // Amount of noise produced, when you reload a gun with this mod
"aim_speed_modifier": -2,       // Changes how fast you aim a gun with this mod
"add_mod": [ [ "grip", 1 ], [ "sights", 1 ] ], // adds this amoutn of gunmods to gun, if this gunmod is installed
"energy_drain_multiplier": 1.2, // if weapon uses `energy_drain`, multiplies it on this amount
"field_of_view": 270,           // #53180 has an image of it, but it represent how big FoV of the scope - when characters start to aim, it doesn't use the scope whatsoever, aiming into "general direction", and then transfer to using scope to pinpoint the target. The bigger FoV is, the sooner character would be able to use the scope (target acquisition with higher power scopes is very very difficult); put simple: the bigger FoV, the faster player can aim, to some degree; measured in MOA (minutes of angle)
"min_skills": [ [ "weapon", 3 ], [ "gun", 4 ] ], // minimal skill level required to install this gunmod
"shot_spread_multiplier_modifier": -0.8, // For shotguns, changes the spread of the pellets. Given a default multiplier of 1.0(100%), a multiplier modifier of -0.8 results in 0.2(20%) shot spread. Multipliers from all mods are summed up, but in vanilla game, only choke should be able to manipulate with shot spread - **shotgun barrel length doesn't affect pellet spread**
"energy_drain_modifier": "200 kJ",  // Optional field increasing or decreasing base gun energy consumption (per shot) by adding given value. This addition is not multiplied by energy_drains_multiplier.
"energy_drains_multiplier": 2.5, // Optional field increasing or decreasing base gun energy consumption (per shot) by multiplying by given value.

"ammo_effects": [ "BEANBAG" ], // List of IDs of ammo_effect types
"consume_chance": 5000,        // Odds against CONSUMABLE mod being destroyed when gun is fired (default 1 in 10000)
"consume_divisor": 10,         // Divide damage against mod by this amount (default 1)
"handling_modifier": 4,        // Improve gun handling. For example a forward grip might have 6, a bipod 18
"mode_modifier": [ [ "AUTO", "auto", 4 ] ], // Modify firing modes of the gun, to give AUTO or REACH for example
"barrel_length": "45 mm"       // Specify a direct barrel length for this gun mod. If used only the first mod with a barrel length will be counted
"overheat_threshold_modifier": 100,   // Add a flat amount to gun's "overheat_threshold"; if the threshold is 100, and the modifier is 10, the result is 110; if the modifier is -25, the result is 75
"overheat_threshold_multiplier": 1.5, // Multiply gun's "overheat_threshold" by this number; if the threshold is 100, and the multiplier is 1.5, the result is 150; if the multiplier is 0.8, the result is 80

```

Alternately, every item (book, tool, armor, even food) can be used as a gunmod if it has gunmod_data:
```c++
"type": "TOOL",       // Or any other item type

    ...
}
```

  "folded_parts": "folded_parts_syntax" // this is the parts that this vehice has -it uses it's own syntax, different from `"type": "vehicle"`, so better to read the examples in `unfoldable.json`
}
```


### Seed Data

Every item type can have optional seed data, if the item has seed data, it's considered a seed and can be planted:

```C++
"seed_data" : {
    "fruit": "weed", // The item id of the fruits that this seed will produce.
    "seeds": false, // (optional, default is true). If true, harvesting the plant will spawn seeds (the same type as the item used to plant). If false only the fruits are spawned, no seeds.
    "fruit_div": 2, // (optional, default is 1). Final amount of fruit charges produced is divided by this number. Works only if fruit item is counted by charges.
    "byproducts": ["withered", "straw_pile"], // A list of further items that should spawn upon harvest.
    "plant_name": "sunflower", // The name of the plant that grows from this seed. This is only used as information displayed to the user.
    "grow" : 91, // A time duration: how long it takes for a plant to fully mature. Based around a 91 day season length (roughly a real world season) to give better accuracy for longer season lengths
                // Note that growing time is later converted based upon the season_length option, basing it around 91 is just for accuracy purposes
                // A value 91 means 3 full seasons, a value of 30 would mean 1 season.
    "required_terrain_flag": "PLANTABLE" // A tag that terrain and furniture would need to have in order for the seed to be plantable there.
					 // Default is "PLANTABLE", and using this will cause any terain the plant is wrown on to turn into dirt once the plant is planted, unless furniture is used.
					 // Using any other tag will not turn the terrain into dirt.
}
```

### Brewing Data

Every item type can have optional brewing data, if the item has brewing data, it can be placed in a vat and will ferment into a different item type.

Currently only vats can only accept and produce liquid items.

```C++
"brewable" : {
    "time": 3600, // A time duration: how long the fermentation will take.
    "results": { "beer": 1, "yeast": 10 } // Ids with a multiplier for the amount of results per charge of the brewable items.
}
```

},
```

### Drop Actions

Similar to use_action, this drop_actions would be triggered when you throw the item

```c++
"drop_action": {                  
  "type": "emit_actor",           // allow to emit a specific field when thrown
  "emits": [ "emit_acid_drop" ],  // id of emit to spread
  "scale_qty": true               // if true, throwing more than one charge of item with emit_actor increases the size of emission
  }
```

### Tick Actions

`"tick_action"` of active tools is executed once on every turn. This action can be any use action or iuse but some of them may not work properly when not executed by player.

If `"tick_action"` is defined as array of multiple actions they all are executed in order. Multiple use actions of same type cannot be used at once.
  
#### Delayed Item Actions

Item use actions can be used with a timer delay.

Item `"transform"` action can set and start the timer. This timer starts when the player activates the item.
```
"use_action": {
    "type": "transform"
    "target": "grenade_act",
    "target_timer": "5 seconds"  // Sets timer on item to this
}
```

Timer inherent to the item itself can be set by defining `"countdown_interval"` in item json. This timer is started at the birth of the item.

```
    "id": "migo_plate_undergrown",
    "name": { "str": "undergrown iridescent carapace plate" },
    "countdown_interval": "24 hours",
```

Once the duration of the timer has passed the `"countdown_action"` is executed. This action can be any use action but many actions do not behave well when they are not triggered by the player.

```
"countdown_action": {
    "type": "explosion",
    "explosion": { "power": 240, "shrapnel": { "casing_mass": 217, "fragment_mass": 0.08 } }
}
```

Additionally `"revert_to"` can be defined in item definitions (not in use action). The item is deactivated and turned to this type after the `"countdown_action"`. If no revert_to is specified the item is destroyed.


### Item Properties

Properties are bound to item's type definition and code checks for them for special behaviour,
for example the property below makes a container burst open when filled over 75% and it's thrown.

```json
  {
    "properties": { "burst_when_filled": "75" }
  }
```

### Item Variables

Item variables are plain strings of data stored within item and used to serialize special behaviour,
for example folding a vehicle serializes the folded vehicle's name and list of parts
(part type ids, part damage, degradation etc) into json string for use when unfolding.

Alternatively item variables may also originate from the item's prototype. Specifying them
can be done in the item's definition, add the `variables` key and inside write a key-value
map.

all values of variable are written as string
Example:
```json
    "variables": { "variable_name": "value" }
```
```json
    "variables": { "browsed": "false" }
```
```json
    "variables": { "water_per_tablet": "4" }
```

This will make any item instantiated from that prototype get assigned this variable, once
the item is spawned the variables set on the prototype no longer affect the item's variables,
a migration can clear out the item's variables and reassign the prototype ones if reset_item_vars
flag is set.

Also item variables can be assigned and read by effect_on_conditions
```c++
{ "math": [ "n_variablename = rand(5, 100)" ] } // assuming beta talker, aka n_, is item

{ "math": [ "n_variablename > 50 ? u_pain()++ : u_pain()--" ] }
```

{
  "set_string_var": [ "foo", "bar", "xyz", "qwe", "rty" ],
  "target_var": { "npc_val": "variablename" }
}
