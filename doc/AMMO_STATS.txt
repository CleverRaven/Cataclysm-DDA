The damage of ammunition is the square root of a round's muzzle energy in joules rounded to the nearest integer with an arbitrary increase or decrease to account for terminal ballistics. A similar system for calculating recoil is planned but not currently being worked on. The figures used to calulate stats and any other relevant information is as follows:

7.62x39mm M43:
123gr steel core FMJ bullet - damage lowered by 15
1607J muzzle energy - √1607=47

7.62x39mm M67:
123gr steel core FMJ bullet - damage lowered by 9
1607J muzzle energy - √1607=47

5.45x39mm 7N10:
56gr FMJ bullet - damage increased by 3
1402J muzzle energy - √1402=37

5.45x39mm 7N22:
57gr steel core FMJ bullet
1461J muzzle energy - √1461=38

.223 Remington:
36gr JHP bullet - damage increased by 5
1524J muzzle energy - √1524=39

.308 Winchester:
168gr hollow point bullet
3570J muzzle energy - √3570=60

7.62 NATO M80:
147gr FMJ bullet
3304J muzzle energy - √3304=57

7.62 NATO M62:
Belt with 1/5 tracer rounds
147gr FMJ bullet
3304J muzzle energy - √3304=57

.270 Winchester:
130gr soft point bullet
3663J muzzle energy - √3663=61

.30-06 Springfield:
165gr soft point bullet - damage increased by 4
3894J muzzle energy - √3894=62

.30-06 M2:
165gr FMJ bullet - damage reduced by 10
3894J muzzle energy - √3894=62

.30-06 M14A1:
Incendiary ammunition - damage reduced by 10
3894J muzzle energy - √3894=62
