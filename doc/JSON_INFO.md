#### Group definition

| Identifier | Description
|---         |---
| `name`     | Unique ID. Must be one continuous word, use underscores if necessary.
| `default`  | Default monster, automatically fills in any remaining spawn chances.
| `monsters` | To choose a monster for spawning, the game creates 1000 entries and picks one. Each monster will have a number of entries equal to it's "freq" and the default monster will fill in the remaining. See the table below for how to build the single monster definitions.

#### Monster definition

| Identifier   | Description
|---           |---
| `monster`    | The monster's id.
| `freq`       | Chance of occurrence, out of a thousand.
| `multiplier` | How many monsters each monster in this definition should count as, if spawning a limited number of monsters.
| `pack_size`  | (_optional_) The minimum and maximum number of monsters in this group that should spawn together.  (default: `[1,1]`)
| `conditions` | Conditions limit when monsters spawn. Valid options: `SUMMER`, `WINTER`, `AUTUMN`, `SPRING`, `DAY`, `NIGHT`, `DUSK`, `DAWN`. Multiple Time-of-day conditions (`DAY`, `NIGHT`, `DUSK`, `DAWN`) will be combined together so that any of those conditions makes the spawn valid. Multiple Season conditions (`SUMMER`, `WINTER`, `AUTUMN`, `SPRING`) will be combined together so that any of those conditions makes the spawn valid.

```json
{
    "name" : "GROUP_ANT",
    "default" : "mon_ant",
    "monsters" : [
        { "monster" : "mon_ant_larva", "freq" : 40, "multiplier" : 0 },

```

### Monsters

See MONSTERS.md

### Names

```json
{ "name" : "Aaliyah", "gender" : "female", "usage" : "given" }, // Name, gender, "given"/"family"/"city" (first/last/city name).
// NOTE: Please refrain from adding name PR's in order to maintain kickstarter exclusivity
```

### Professions

Professions are specified as JSON object with "type" member set to "profession":

```JSON
{
    "type": "profession",
    "ident": "hunter",
    ...
}
```

The ident member should be the unique id of the profession.

The following properties (mandatory, except if noted otherwise) are supported:

#### `description`
(string)

The in-game description.

#### `name`
(string or object with members "male" and "female")

The in-game name, either one gender-neutral string, or an object with gender specific names. Example:
```JSON
"name": {
    "male": "Groom",
    "female": "Bride"
}
```

#### `points`
(integer)

Point cost of profession. Positive values cost points and negative values grant points.

#### `addictions`
(optional, array of addictions)

List of starting addictions. Each entry in the list should be an object with the following members:
- "type": the string id of the addiction (see JSON_FLAGS.md),
- "intensity": intensity (integer) of the addiction.

Example:
```JSON
"addictions": [
    { "type": "nicotine", "intensity": 10 }
]
```

Mods can modify this list (requires `"edit-mode": "modify"`, see example) via "add:addictions" and "remove:addictions", removing requires only the addiction type. Example:
```JSON
{
    "type": "profession",
    "ident": "hunter",
    "edit-mode": "modify",
    "remove:addictions": [
        "nicotine"
    ],
    "add:addictions": [
        { "type": "alcohol", "intensity": 10 }
    ]
}
```

#### `skills`

(optional, array of skill levels)

List of starting skills. Each entry in the list should be an object with the following members:
- "name": the string id of the skill (see skills.json),
- "level": level (integer) of the skill. This is added to the skill level that can be chosen in the character creation.

Example:
```JSON
"skills": [
    { "name": "archery", "level": 2 }
]
```

Mods can modify this list (requires `"edit-mode": "modify"`, see example) via "add:skills" and "remove:skills", removing requires only the skill id. Example:
```JSON
{
    "type": "profession",
    "ident": "hunter",
    "edit-mode": "modify",
    "remove:skills": [
        "archery"
    ],
    "add:skills": [
        { "name": "computer", "level": 2 }
    ]
}
```

#### `items`

(optional, object with optional members "both", "male" and "female")

Items the player starts with when selecting this profession. One can specify different items based on the gender of the character. Each lists of items should be an array of items ids, or pairs of item ids and snippet ids. Item ids may appear multiple times, in which case the item is created multiple times. The syntax for each of the three lists is identical.

Example:
```JSON
"items": {
    "both": [
        "pants",
        "rock",
        "rock",
        ["tshirt_text", "allyourbase"],
        "socks"
    ],
    "male": [
        "briefs"
    ],
    "female": [
        "panties"
    ]
}
```

This gives the player pants, two rocks, a t-shirt with the snippet id "allyourbase" (giving it a special description), socks and (depending on the gender) briefs or panties.

Mods can modify the lists of existing professions. This requires the "edit-mode" member with value "modify" (see example). Adding items to the lists can be done with via "add:both" / "add:male" / "add:female". It allows the same content (it allows adding items with snippet ids). Removing items is done via "remove:both" / "remove:male" / "remove:female", which may only contain items ids.

Example for mods:

```JSON
{
    "type": "profession",
    "ident": "hunter",
    "edit-mode": "modify",
    "items": {
        "remove:both": [
            "rock",
            "tshirt_text"
        ],
        "add:both": [ "2x4" ],
        "add:female": [
            ["tshirt_text", "allyourbase"]
        ]
    }
}
```

This mod removes one of the rocks (the other rock is still created), the t-shirt, adds a 2x4 item and gives female characters a t-shirt with the special snippet id.

#### `flags`

(optional, array of strings)

A list of flags. TODO: document those flags here.

Mods can modify this via `add:flags` and `remove:flags`.

#### `cbms`

(optional, array of strings)

A list of CBM ids that are implanted in the character.

Mods can modify this via `add:CBMs` and `remove:CBMs`.

#### `traits`

(optional, array of strings)

A list of trait/mutation ids that are applied to the character.

Mods can modify this via `add:traits` and `remove:traits`.

### Armor

Armor can be defined like this:

```json
"type" : "ARMOR",     // Defines this as armor
...                   // same entries as above for the generic item.
                      // additional some armor specific entries:

"required_level" : 2  // Minimum skill level required to learn
```
Alternately, every item (tool, gun, even food) can be used as book if it has book_data:
```json
"type" : "TOOL",      // Or any other item type
...                   // same entries as for the type (e.g. same entries as for any tool),

    "required_level" : 2
}
```

#### Color Key

When adding a new book, please use this color key:

* Magazines: `pink`
* “Paperbacks” Short enjoyment books (including novels): `light_cyan`
* “Hardbacks” Long enjoyment books (including novels): `light_blue`
* “Small textbook” Beginner level textbooks, guides and martial arts books: `dark_green`
* “Large textbook” Advanced level textbooks and advanced guides: `dark_blue`
* Religious books: `dark_gray`
* “Printouts” (including spiral-bound and similar) Technical documents, (technical?) protocols, (lab) journals: `light_green`
* Other reading material/non-books (use only if every other category does not apply): `light_gray`

A few exceptions to this color key may apply, for example for books that don’t are what they seem to be.
Never use `yellow` and `red`, those colors are reserved for sounds and infrared vision.

### Comestibles

```json
"type" : "COMESTIBLE",      // Defines this as a COMESTIBLE
...                         // same entries as above for the generic item.
                            // additional some comestible specific entries:

"spoils_in" : 0,            // How long a comestible is good for. 0 = no spoilage
"use_action" : "CRACK",     // What effects a comestible has when used, see special definitions below

"heal" : -2,                // Health effects (used for sickness chances)
"addiction_potential" : 80, // Ability to cause addictions
"nutrition" : 0,            // Hunger satisfied

"stack_size" : 8,           // (Optional) How many uses are in the above-defined volume. If omitted, is the same as 'charges'
"fun" : 50                  // Morale effects when used
```

### Containers

```json
"type": "CONTAINER",  // Defines this as a container
...                   // same data as for the generic item (see above).
"contains": 200,      // How much volume this container can hold
"seals": false,       // Can be resealed, this is a required for it to be used for liquids. (optional, default: false)
"watertight": false,  // Can hold liquids, this is a required for it to be used for liquids. (optional, default: false)
"preserves": false,   // Contents do not spoil. (optional, default: false)
```
Alternately, every item can be used as container:
```json
"type": "ARMOR",      // Any type is allowed here
...                   // same data as for the type
"container_data" : {  // The container specific data goes here.
    "contains": 200,
}
```
This defines a armor (you need to add all the armor specific entries), but makes it usable as container.
It could also be written as a generic item ("type": "GENERIC") with "armor_data" and "container_data" entries.

### Seed Data

Every item type can have optional seed data, if the item has seed data, it's considered a seed and can be planted:

```
"seed_data" : {
    "fruits": "weed", // The item id of the fruits that this seed will produce.
    "seeds": false, // (optional, default is true). If true, harvesting the plant will spawn seeds (the same type as the item used to plant). If false only the fruits are spawned, no seeds.
    "fruit_div": 2, // (optional, default is 1). Final amount of fruit charges produced is divided by this number. Works only if fruit item is counted by charges.
    "byproducts": ["withered", "straw_pile"], // A list of further items that should spawn upon harvest.
    "plant_name": "sunflower", // The name of the plant that grows from this seed. This is only used as information displayed to the user.
    "grow" : 91 // Time it takes for a plant to fully mature. Based around a 91 day season length (roughly a real world season) to give better accuracy for longer season lengths
                // Note that growing time is later converted based upon the season_length option, basing it around 91 is just for accuracy purposes
                // A value 91 means 3 full seasons, a value of 30 would mean 1 season.
}
```

### Artifact Data

```

###random Descriptions

Any item with a "snippet_category" entry will have random descriptions, based on that snippet category:
```
"snippet_category": "newspaper",
```
The item descriptions are taken from snippets, which can be specified like this (the value of category must match the snippet_category in the item definition):
```
{
    "type" : "snippet",
    "category" : "newspaper",
    "id" : "snippet-id",          // id is optional, it's used when the snippet is referenced in the item list of professions
    "text": "your flavor text"
}
```
or several snippets at once:
```
{
    "type" : "snippet",
    "category" : "newspaper",
    "text": [
        "your flavor text",
        "more flavor",
        // entries can also bo of this form to have a id to reference that specific snippet.
        { "id" : "snippet-id", "text" : "another flavor text" }
    ]
    "text": [ "your flavor text", "another flavor text", "more flavor" ]
}
```
Multiple snippets for the same category are possible and actually recommended. The game will select a random one for each item of that type.

One can also put the snippets directly in the item definition:
```
"snippet_category": [ "text 1", "text 2", "text 3" ],
```
This will automatically create a snippet category specific to that item and populate that category with the given snippets.
The format also support snippet ids like above.

}
```

#### `type`

Fixed string, must be `furniture` to identify the JSON object as such.

`"id", "name", "symbol", "color", "bgcolor", "max_volume", "open", "close", "bash", "deconstruct", "examine_action", "flgs`

Same as for terrain, see below in the chapter "Common to furniture and terrain".

#### `move_cost_mod`

Movement cost modifier (`-10` = impassable, `0` = no change). This is added to the movecost of the underlying terrain.

#### `required_str`

Strength required to move the furniture around. Negative values indicate an unmovable furniture.

#### `crafting_pseudo_item`

(Optional) Id of an item (tool) that will be available for crafting when this furniture is range (the furniture acts as an item of that type).

### Terrain

```JSON
{
    "type": "terrain",
    "id": "t_spiked_pit",
    "name": "spiked pit",
    "symbol": "0",
    "color": "ltred",
    "move_cost": 10,
    "trap": "spike_pit",
    "max_volume": 4000,
    "flags": ["TRANSPARENT", "DIGGABLE"],
    "connects_to" : "WALL",
    "close": "t_foo_closed",
    "open": "t_foo_open",
    "bash": "TODO",
    "deconstruct": "TODO",
    "harvestable": "blueberries",
    "transforms_into": "t_tree_harvested",
    "harvest_season": "WINTER",
    "roof": "t_roof",
    "examine_action": "pit"
}
```

#### `type`

Fixed string, must be "terrain" to identify the JSON object as such.

`"id", "name", "symbol", "color", "bgcolor", "max_volume", "open", "close", "bash", "deconstruct", "examine_action", "flgs`

Same as for furniture, see below in the chapter "Common to furniture and terrain".

#### `move_cost`

Move cost to move through. A value of 0 means it's impassable (e.g. wall). You should not use negative values. The positive value is multiple of 50 move points, e.g. value 2 means the player uses 2*50 = 100 move points when moving across the terrain.

#### `trap`

(Optional) Id of the build-in trap of that terrain.

For example the terrain `t_pit` has the built-in trap `tr_pit`. Every tile in the game that has the terrain `t_pit` also has, therefore, an implicit trap `tr_pit` on it. The two are inseparable (the player can not deactivate the built-in trap, and changing the terrain will also deactivate the built-in trap).

A built-in trap prevents adding any other trap explicitly (by the player and through mapgen).

#### `harvestable`

(Optional) If defined, the terrain is harvestable. This entry defines the item type of the harvested fruits (or similar). To make this work, you also have to set one of the `harvest_*` `examine_action` functions.

#### `transforms_into`

(Optional) Used for various transformation of the terrain. If defined, it must be a valid terrain id. Used for example:

- When harvesting fruits (to change into the harvested form of the terrain).
- In combination with the `HARVESTED` flag and `harvest_season` to change the harvested terrain back into a terrain with fruits.

#### `harvest_season`

(Optional) On of "SUMMER", "AUTUMN", "WINTER", "SPRING", used in combination with the "HARVESTED" flag to revert the terrain back into a terrain that can be harvested.

#### `roof`

(Optional) The terrain of the terrain on top of this (the roof).

### Common To Furniture And Terrain

Some values can/must be set for terrain and furniture. They have the same meaning in each case.

#### `id`

Id of the object, this should be unique among all object of that type (all terrain or all furniture types). By convention (but technically not needed), the id should have the "f_" prefix for furniture and the "t_" prefix for terrain. This is not translated. It must not be changed later as that would break save compatibility.

#### `name`

Displayed name of the object. This will be translated.

#### `flags`

(Optional) Various additional flags, see "doc/JSON_FLAGS.md".

#### `connects_to`

(Optional) The group of terrains to which this terrain connects. This affects tile rotation and connections, and the ASCII symbol drawn by terrain with the flag "AUTO_WALL_SYMBOL".

Current values:
- `CHAINFENCE`
- `RAILING`
- `WALL`
- `WATER`
- `WOODFENCE`

Example: `-` , `|` , `X` and `Y` are terrain which share the same `connects_to` value. `O` does not have it. `X` and `Y` also have the `AUTO_WALL_SYMBOL` flag. `X` will be drawn as a T-intersection (connected to west, south and east), `Y` will be drawn as a horizontal line (going from west to east, no connection to south).

```
-X-    -Y-
 |      O
```

#### `symbol`

ASCII symbol of the object as it appears in the game. The symbol string must be exactly one character long. This can also be an array of 4 strings, which define the symbol during the different seasons. The first entry defines the symbol during spring. If it's not an array, the same symbol is used all year round.

#### `color` or `bgcolor`

Color of the object as it appears in the game. "color" defines the foreground color (no background color), "bgcolor" defines a solid background color. As with the "symbol" value, this can be an array with 4 entries, each entry being the color during the different seasons.

> **NOTE**: You must use ONLY ONE of "color" or "bgcolor"

#### `max_volume`

(Optional) Maximal volume that can be used to store items here.

#### `examine_action`

(Optional) The json function that is called when the object is examined. See "src/iexamine.h".

#### `close" And "open`

(Optional) The value should be a terrain id (inside a terrain entry) or a furniture id (in a furniture entry). If either is defined, the player can open / close the object. Opening / closing will change the object at the affected tile to the given one. For example one could have object "safe_c", which "open"s to "safe_o" and "safe_o" in turn "close"s to "safe_c". Here "safe_c" and "safe_o" are two different terrain (or furniture) types that have different properties.

#### `bash`

(Optional) Defines whether the object can be bashed and if so, what happens. See "map_bash_info".

#### `deconstruct`

(Optional) Defines whether the object can be deconstructed and if so, what the results shall be. See "map_deconstruct_info".

#### `map_bash_info`

Defines the various things that happen when the player or something else bashes terrain or furniture.

```JSON

    "str_min": 80,
    "str_max": 180,
    "str_min_blocked": 15,
    "str_max_blocked": 100,

    "items": "bashed_item_result_group"
}
```

#### `str_min`, `str_max`, `str_min_blocked`, `str_max_blocked`, `str_min_supported`, `str_max_supported`

TODO

#### `sound`, `sound_fail`, `sound_vol`, `sound_fail_vol`
(Optional) Sound and volume of the sound that appears upon destroying the bashed object or upon unsuccessfully bashing it (failing). The sound strings are translated (and displayed to the player).

#### `furn_set`, `ter_set`

The terrain / furniture that will be set when the original is destroyed. This is mandatory for bash entries in terrain, but optional for entries in furniture (it defaults to no furniture).

#### `explosive`
(Optional) If greater than 0, destroying the object causes an explosion with this strength (see `game::explosion`).

#### `destroy_only`
TODO

#### `bash_below`
TODO

#### `tent_centers`, `collapse_radius`
(Optional) For furniture that is part of tents, this defines the id of the center part, which will be destroyed as well when other parts of the tent get bashed. The center is searched for in the given "collapse_radius" radius, it should match the size of the tent.

#### `items`

(Optional) An item group (inline) or an id of an item group, see doc/ITEM_SPAWN.md. The default subtype is "collection". Upon successful bashing, items from that group will be spawned.

#### `map_deconstruct_info`

```JSON
{
    "furn_set": "f_safe",
    "ter_set": "t_dirt",
    "items": "deconstructed_item_result_group"
}
```

#### `furn_set`, `ter_set`

The terrain / furniture that will be set after the original has been deconstructed. "furn_set" is optional (it defaults to no furniture), "ter_set" is only used upon "deconstruct" entries in terrain and is mandatory there.

### `items`

(Optional) An item group (inline) or an id of an item group, see doc/ITEM_SPAWN.md. The default subtype is "collection". Upon deconstruction the object, items from that group will be spawned.

# Scenarios

Scenarios are specified as JSON object with `type` member set to `scenario`.

```JSON
{
    "type": "scenario",
    "ident": "schools_out",
    ...
}
```

The ident member should be the unique id of the scenario.

The following properties (mandatory, except if noted otherwise) are supported:


## `description`
(string)

The in-game description.

## `name`
(string or object with members "male" and "female")

The in-game name, either one gender-neutral string, or an object with gender specific names. Example:
```JSON
"name": {
    "male": "Runaway groom",
    "female": "Runaway bride"
}
```

## `points`
(integer)

Point cost of scenario. Positive values cost points and negative values grant points.

## `items`
(optional, object with optional members "both", "male" and "female")

Items the player starts with when selecting this scenario. One can specify different items based on the gender of the character. Each lists of items should be an array of items ids. Ids may appear multiple times, in which case the item is created multiple times.

Example:
```JSON
"items": {
    "both": [
        "pants",
        "rock",
        "rock"
    ],
    "male": [ "briefs" ],
    "female": [ "panties" ]
}
```
This gives the player pants, two rocks and (depending on the gender) briefs or panties.

Mods can modify the lists of an existing scenario via "add:both" / "add:male" / "add:female" and "remove:both" / "remove:male" / "remove:female".

Example for mods:
```JSON
{
    "type": "scenario",
    "ident": "schools_out",
    "edit-mode": "modify",
    "items": {
        "remove:both": [ "rock" ],
        "add:female": [ "2x4" ]
    }
}
```

## `flags`
(optional, array of strings)

A list of flags. TODO: document those flags here.

Mods can modify this via "add:flags" and "remove:flags".

## `cbms`
(optional, array of strings)

A list of CBM ids that are implanted in the character.

Mods can modify this via "add:CBMs" and "remove:CBMs".

## `traits", "forced_traits", "forbidden_traits`
(optional, array of strings)

Lists of trait/mutation ids. Traits in "forbidden_traits" are forbidden and can't be selected during the character creation. Traits in "forced_traits" are automatically added to character. Traits in "traits" enables them to be chosen, even if they are not starting traits.

Mods can modify this via "add:traits" / "add:forced_traits" / "add:forbidden_traits" and "remove:traits" / "remove:forced_traits" / "remove:forbidden_traits".

## `allowed_locs`
(optional, array of strings)

A list of starting location ids (see start_locations.json) that can be chosen when using this scenario.

## `start_name`
(string)

The name that is shown for the starting location. This is useful if the scenario allows several starting locations, but the game can not list them all at once in the scenario description. Example: if the scenario allows to start somewhere in the wilderness, the starting locations would contain forest and fields, but its "start_name" may simply be "wilderness".

## `professions`
(optional, array of strings)

A list of allowed professions that can be chosen when using this scenario. The first entry is the default profession. If this is empty, all professions are allowed.

## `map_special`
(optional, string)

Add a map special to the starting location, see JSON_FLAGS for the possible specials.

# Starting locations

Starting locations are specified as JSON object with "type" member set to "start_location":
```JSON
{
    "type": "start_location",
    "ident": "field",
    "name": "An empty field",
    "target": "field",
    ...
}
```

The ident member should be the unique id of the location.

The following properties (mandatory, except if noted otherwise) are supported:

## `name`
(string)

The in-game name of the location.

## `target`
(string)

The id of an overmap terrain type (see overmap_terrain.json) of the starting location. The game will chose a random place with that terrain.

## `flags`
(optional, array of strings)

Arbitrary flags. Mods can modify this via "add:flags" / "remove:flags". TODO: document them.

### `tile_config`
Each tileset has a tile_config.json describing how to map the contents of a sprite sheet to various tile identifiers, different orientations, etc. The ordering of the overlays used for displaying mutations can be controlled as well. The ordering can be used to override the default ordering provided in `mutation_ordering.json`. Example:

```JSON
  {                                             // whole file is a single object
    "tile_info": [                              // tile_info is mandatory
      {
        "height": 32,
        "width": 32,
        "iso" : true,                             //  Optional. Indicates an isometric tileset. Defaults to false.
        "pixelscale" : 2                          //  Optional. Sets a multiplier for resizing a tileset. Defaults to 1.
      }
    ],
    "tiles-new": [                              // tiles-new is an array of sprite sheets
      {                                           //   alternately, just one "tiles" array
        "file": "tiles.png",                      // file containing sprites in a grid
        "tiles": [                                // array with one entry per tile
          {
            "id": "10mm",                         // id is how the game maps things to sprites
            "fg": 1,                              //   lack of prefix mostly indicates items
            "bg": 632,                            // fg and bg can be sprite indexes in the image
            "rotates": false
          },
          {
            "id": "t_wall",                       // "t_" indicates terrain
            "fg": [2918, 2919, 2918, 2919],       // 2 or 4 sprite numbers indicates pre-rotated

      }
    ]
  }
```

# Mutation overlay ordering

The file `mutation_ordering.json` defines the order that visual mutation overlays are rendered on a character ingame. The layering value from 0 (bottom) - 9999 (top) sets the order.

Example:
```JSON
[
    {
        "type" : "overlay_order",
        "overlay_ordering" :
        [
        {
            "id" : [ "BEAUTIFUL", "BEAUTIFUL2", "BEAUTIFUL3", "LARGE", "PRETTY", "RADIOACTIVE1", "RADIOACTIVE2", "RADIOACTIVE3", "REGEN" ],
            "order" : 1000
        },{
            "id" : [ "HOOVES", "ROOTS1", "ROOTS2", "ROOTS3", "TALONS" ],
            "order" : 4500
        },{
            "id" : "FLOWERS",
            "order" : 5000
        },{
            "id" : [ "PROF_CYBERCOP", "PROF_FED", "PROF_PD_DET", "PROF_POLICE", "PROF_SWAT", "PHEROMONE_INSECT" ],
            "order" : 8500
        }
        ]
    }
]
```

## `id`
(string)

The internal ID of the mutation. Can be provided as a single string, or an array of strings. The order value provided will be applied to all items in the array.

## `order`
(integer)

The ordering value of the mutation overlay. Values range from 0 - 9999, 9999 being the topmost drawn layer. Mutations that are not in any list will default to 9999.
