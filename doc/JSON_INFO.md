# Generic properties and formatting
This section describes properties and formatting applied to all of the JSON files.

## Generic properties
A few properties are applicable to most if not all json files and do not need to be described for each json file. These properties are:

| Identifier               | Description
|---                       |---
| type                     | The type of object this json entry is describing. Setting this entry to 'armor' for example means the game will expect properties specific to armor in that entry. Also ties in with 'copy-from' (see below), if you want to inherit properties of another object, it must be of the same tipe.
| [copy-from](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/tree/master/doc/JSON_INHERITANCE.md)                | The identifier of the item you wish to copy properties from. This allows you to make an exact copy of an item __of the same type__ and only provide entries that should change from the item you copied from. 
| [extends](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/tree/master/doc/JSON_INHERITANCE.md)                  | Modders can add an "extends" field to their definition to append entries to a list instead of overriding the entire list.
| [delete](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/tree/master/doc/JSON_INHERITANCE.md)                   | Modders can also add a "delete" field that removes elements from lists instead of overriding the entire list.
| [abstract](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/tree/master/doc/JSON_INHERITANCE.md)                 | Creates an abstract item (an item that does not end up in the game and solely exists in the json to be copied-from. Use this _instead of_ 'id'. 



## Formatting
When editing JSON files make sure you apply the correct formatting as shown below.

### Time duration

A string containing one or more pairs of number and time duration unit. Number and unit, as well as each pair, can be separated by an arbitrary amount of spaces.
Available units:
- "hours", "hour", "h" - one hour
- "days", "day", "d" - one day
- "minutes", "minute", "m" - one minute
- "turns", "turn", "t" - one turn,

Examples:
- " +1 day -23 hours 50m " `(1*24*60 - 23*60 + 50 == 110 minutes)`
- "1 turn 1 minutes 9 turns" (1 minute and 10 seconds because 1 turn is 1 second)

### Other formatting

```C++
"//" : "comment", // Preferred method of leaving comments inside json files.
```

Some json strings are extracted for translation, for example item names, descriptions, etc. The exact extraction is handled in `lang/extract_json_strings.py`. Apart from the obvious way of writing a string without translation context, the string can also have an optional translation context (and sometimes a plural form), by writing it like:

```JSON
"name": { "ctxt": "foo", "str": "bar", "str_pl": "baz" }
```

You can also add comments for translators by adding a "//~" entry like below. The
order of the entries does not matter.

```JSON
"name": {
    "//~": "as in 'foobar'",
    "str": "bar"
}
```

Currently, only some JSON values support this syntax (see [here](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/master/doc/TRANSLATING.md#translation) for a list of supported values and more detailed explanation).

# Description and content of each JSON file
This section describes each json file and their contents. Each json has their own unique properties that are not shared with other Json files (for example 'chapters' property used in books does not apply to armor). This will make sure properties are only described and used within the context of the appropriate JSON file.


## `data/json/` JSONs

### Bionics

| Identifier                  | Description

| occupied_bodyparts          | (_optional_) A list of body parts occupied by this bionic, and the number of bionic slots it take on those parts.
| capacity                    | (_optional_) Amount of power storage added by this bionic.  Strings can be used "1 kJ"/"1000 J"/"1000000 mJ" (default: `0`)
| fuel_options                | (_optional_) A list of fuel that this bionic can use to produce bionic power.

    "env_protec": [ [ "MOUTH", 7 ] ],
    "flags": [ "BIONIC_NPC_USABLE" ]
}
```

Bionics effects are defined in the code and new effects cannot be created through JSON alone.
When adding a new bionic, if it's not included with another one, you must also add the corresponding CBM item in `data/json/items/bionics.json`. Even for a faulty bionic.

### Monster Groups

#### Group definition

| Identifier  | Description
|---          |---
| `name`      | Unique ID. Must be one continuous word, use underscores if necessary.
| `default`   | Default monster, automatically fills in any remaining spawn chances.
| `monsters`  | To choose a monster for spawning, the game creates 1000 entries and picks one. Each monster will have a number of entries equal to it's "freq" and the default monster will fill in the remaining. See the table below for how to build the single monster definitions.
| `is_safe`   | (bool) Check to not trigger safe-mode warning.
| `is_animal` | (bool) Check if that group has only normal animals. 

#### Monster definition

| Identifier        | Description
|---                |---
| `monster`         | The monster's id.
| `freq`            | Chance of occurrence, x/1000.
| `cost_multiplier` | How many monsters each monster in this definition should count as, if spawning a limited number of monsters.
| `pack_size`       | (_optional_) The minimum and maximum number of monsters in this group that should spawn together.  (default: `[1,1]`)
| `conditions`      | Conditions limit when monsters spawn. Valid options: `SUMMER`, `WINTER`, `AUTUMN`, `SPRING`, `DAY`, `NIGHT`, `DUSK`, `DAWN`. Multiple Time-of-day conditions (`DAY`, `NIGHT`, `DUSK`, `DAWN`) will be combined together so that any of those conditions makes the spawn valid. Multiple Season conditions (`SUMMER`, `WINTER`, `AUTUMN`, `SPRING`) will be combined together so that any of those conditions makes the spawn valid.
| `starts`          | (_optional_) This entry becomes active after this time. (Measured in hours)
| `ends`            | (_optional_) This entry becomes inactive after this time. (Measured in hours)

```C++
{
    "name" : "GROUP_ANT",
    "default" : "mon_ant",
    "monsters" : [
        { "monster" : "mon_ant_larva", "freq" : 40, "multiplier" : 0 },
        { "monster" : "mon_ant_soldier", "freq" : 90, "multiplier" : 5 },

### Monster Factions

| Identifier      | Description
|---              |---
| `name`          | Unique ID. Must be one continuous word, use underscores when necessary.
| `base_faction`  | Optional base faction. Relations to other factions are inherited from it and relations of other factions to this one check this.

    "base_faction" : "zombie",
    "by_mood"      : ["blob"],
    "neutral"      : ["nether"],
    "friendly"     : ["blob"]
}
```

### Monsters

See MONSTERS.md

### Names

```C++
{ "name" : "Aaliyah", "gender" : "female", "usage" : "given" }, // Name, gender, "given"/"family"/"city" (first/last/city name).
// NOTE: Please refrain from adding name PR's in order to maintain kickstarter exclusivity
```

### Professions

Professions are specified as JSON object with "type" member set to "profession":

```C++
{
    "type": "profession",
    "ident": "hunter",
    ...
}
```

The ident member should be the unique id of the profession.

The following properties (mandatory, except if noted otherwise) are supported:

#### `description`
(string)

The in-game description.

#### `name`
(string or object with members "male" and "female")

The in-game name, either one gender-neutral string, or an object with gender specific names. Example:
```C++
"name": {
    "male": "Groom",
    "female": "Bride"
}
```

#### `points`
(integer)

Point cost of profession. Positive values cost points and negative values grant points.

#### `addictions`
(optional, array of addictions)

List of starting addictions. Each entry in the list should be an object with the following members:
- "type": the string id of the addiction (see JSON_FLAGS.md),
- "intensity": intensity (integer) of the addiction.

Example:
```C++
"addictions": [
    { "type": "nicotine", "intensity": 10 }
]
```

Mods can modify this list (requires `"edit-mode": "modify"`, see example) via "add:addictions" and "remove:addictions", removing requires only the addiction type. Example:
```C++
{
    "type": "profession",
    "ident": "hunter",
    "edit-mode": "modify",
    "remove:addictions": [
        "nicotine"
    ],
    "add:addictions": [
        { "type": "alcohol", "intensity": 10 }
    ]
}
```

#### `skills`

(optional, array of skill levels)

List of starting skills. Each entry in the list should be an object with the following members:
- "name": the string id of the skill (see skills.json),
- "level": level (integer) of the skill. This is added to the skill level that can be chosen in the character creation.

Example:
```C++
"skills": [
    { "name": "archery", "level": 2 }
]
```

Mods can modify this list (requires `"edit-mode": "modify"`, see example) via "add:skills" and "remove:skills", removing requires only the skill id. Example:
```C++
{
    "type": "profession",
    "ident": "hunter",
    "edit-mode": "modify",
    "remove:skills": [
        "archery"
    ],
    "add:skills": [
        { "name": "computer", "level": 2 }
    ]
}

```

#### `items`

(optional, object with optional members "both", "male" and "female")

Items the player starts with when selecting this profession. One can specify different items based on the gender of the character. Each lists of items should be an array of items ids, or pairs of item ids and snippet ids. Item ids may appear multiple times, in which case the item is created multiple times. The syntax for each of the three lists is identical.

Example:
```C++
"items": {
    "both": [
        "pants",
        "rock",
        "rock",
        ["tshirt_text", "allyourbase"],
        "socks"
    ],
    "male": [
        "briefs"
    ],
    "female": [
        "panties"
    ]
}
```

This gives the player pants, two rocks, a t-shirt with the snippet id "allyourbase" (giving it a special description), socks and (depending on the gender) briefs or panties.

Mods can modify the lists of existing professions. This requires the "edit-mode" member with value "modify" (see example). Adding items to the lists can be done with via "add:both" / "add:male" / "add:female". It allows the same content (it allows adding items with snippet ids). Removing items is done via "remove:both" / "remove:male" / "remove:female", which may only contain items ids.

Example for mods:

```C++
{
    "type": "profession",
    "ident": "hunter",
    "edit-mode": "modify",
    "items": {
        "remove:both": [
            "rock",
            "tshirt_text"
        ],
        "add:both": [ "2x4" ],
        "add:female": [
            ["tshirt_text", "allyourbase"]
        ]
    }
}
```

This mod removes one of the rocks (the other rock is still created), the t-shirt, adds a 2x4 item and gives female characters a t-shirt with the special snippet id.

#### `pet`

(optional, string mtype_id)

A string that is the same as a monster id
player will start with this as a tamed pet.

#### `flags`

(optional, array of strings)

A list of flags. TODO: document those flags here.

Mods can modify this via `add:flags` and `remove:flags`.

#### `cbms`

(optional, array of strings)

A list of CBM ids that are implanted in the character.

Mods can modify this via `add:CBMs` and `remove:CBMs`.

#### `traits`

(optional, array of strings)

A list of trait/mutation ids that are applied to the character.

Mods can modify this via `add:traits` and `remove:traits`.

### Scent_types

| Identifier               | Description
|---                       |---
| id                       | Unique ID. Must be one continuous word, use underscores if necessary.
| receptive_species        | Species able to track this scent. Must use valid ids defined in `species.json`

```json
  {
    "type": "scent_type",
    "id": "sc_flower",
    "receptive_species": [ "MAMMAL", "INSECT", "MOLLUSK", "BIRD" ]
  }
```

### Scores

Scores are defined in two or three steps based on *events*.  To see what events
exist and what data they contain, read [`event.h`](../src/event.h).

* First, optionally, define an `event_transformation` which converts events as
  generated in-game into a format more suitable for your purpose.
* Second, define an `event_statistic` which summarizes a collection of events
  into a single value (usually a number, but other types of value are
  possible).
* Third, define a `score` which uses such a statistic.

#### `event_transformation`

Currently the only available transformation is to filter the set of events
based on certain constraints.

```C++
"id": "moves_on_horse",
"type": "event_transformation",
"event_type" : "avatar_moves", // An event type.  The transformation will act on events of this type
"value_constraints" : { // A dictionary of constraints
    // Each key is the field to which the constraint applies
    // The value specifies the constraint.
    // "equals" can be used to specify a constant string value the field must take.
    // "equals_statistic" specifies that the value must match the value of some statistic (see below)
    "mount" : { "equals": "mon_horse" }
}
```

#### `event_statistic`

A statistic must specify a source of events via one of the following:

```C++
"event_type" : "avatar_moves" // Consider all moves of this type
"event_transformation" : "moves_on_horse" // Consider moves resulting from this transformation
```

Then it specifies a particular `stat_type` and potentially additional details
as follows:

The number of events:
```C++
"stat_type" : "count"
```

The sum of the numeric value in the specified field across all events:
```C++
"stat_type" : "total"
"field" : "damage"
```

Assume there is only a single event to consider, and take the value of the
given field for that unique event:
```C++
"stat_type": "unique_value",
"field": "avatar_id"
```

#### `score`

Scores simply associate a description to an event for formatting in tabulations
of scores.  The `description` specifies a string which is expected to contain a
`%s` format specifier where the value of the statistic will be inserted.

Note that even though most statistics yield an integer, you should still use
`%s`.

```C++
"id": "score_headshots",
"type": "score",
"description": "Headshots: %s",
"statistic": "avatar_num_headshots"
```

### Skills

```C++
"ident" : "smg",  // Unique ID. Must be one continuous word, use underscores if necessary
"name" : "submachine guns",  // In-game name displayed
"description" : "Your skill with submachine guns and machine pistols. Halfway between a pistol and an assault rifle, these weapons fire and reload quickly, and may fire in bursts, but they are not very accurate.", // In-game description
"tags" : ["gun_type"]  // Special flags (default: none)
```

    "pet_bodytype": "dog",
    "max_pet_vol": "35000 ml",
    "min_pet_vol": "25000 ml",
    "material_thickness" : 1,
    "power_armor" : false
}
```

### Books

Books can be defined like this:

```C++
"type" : "BOOK",      // Defines this as a BOOK
...                   // same entries as above for the generic item.
                      // additional some book specific entries:
"max_level" : 5,      // Maximum skill level this book will train to
"intelligence" : 11,  // Intelligence required to read this book without penalty
"time" : "35 m",          // Time a single read session takes. An integer will be read in minutes or a time string can be used.
"fun" : -2,           // Morale bonus/penalty for reading
"skill" : "computer", // Skill raised
"chapters" : 4,       // Number of chapters (for fun only books), each reading "consumes" a chapter. Books with no chapters left are less fun (because the content is already known to the character).
"required_level" : 2  // Minimum skill level required to learn
```
Alternately, every item (tool, gun, even food) can be used as book if it has book_data:
```C++
"type" : "TOOL",      // Or any other item type
...                   // same entries as for the type (e.g. same entries as for any tool),
"book_data" : {       // additionally the same book data like above
    "max_level" : 5,
    "intelligence" : 11,
    "time" : 35,
    "fun" : -2,
    "skill" : "computer",
    "chapters" : 4,
    "use_action" : "MA_MANUAL", // The book_data can have use functions (see USE ACTIONS) that are triggered when the books has been read. These functions are not triggered by simply activating the item (like tools would).
    "required_level" : 2
}
```

#### Conditional Naming

The `conditional_names` field allows defining alternate names for items that will be displayed instead of (or in addition to) the default name, when specific conditions are met. Take the following (incomplete) definition for `sausage` as an example of the syntax:

```json
{
  "name": "sausage",
  "conditional_names": [
    {
      "type": "FLAG",
      "condition": "CANNIBALISM",
      "name": "Mannwurst"
    },
    {
      "type": "COMPONENT_ID",
      "condition": "mutant",
      "name": { "str": "sinister %s", "str_pl": "sinister %s" }
    }
  ]
}
```

You can list as many conditional names for a given item as you want. Each conditional name must consist of 3 elements:
1. The condition type:
    - `COMPONENT_ID` searches all the components of the item (and all of *their* components, and so on) for an item with the condition string in their ID. The ID only needs to *contain* the condition, not match it perfectly (though it is case sensitive). For example, supplying a condition `mutant` would match `mutant_meat`.
    - `FLAG` which checks if an item has the specified flag (exact match).
2. The condition you want to look for.
3. The name to use if a match is found. Follows all the rules of a standard `name` field, with valid keys being `str`, `str_pl`, and `ctxt`. You may use %s here, which will be replaced by the name of the item. Conditional names defined prior to this one are taken into account.

So, in the above example, if the sausage is made from mutant humanoid meat, and therefore both has the `CANNIBALISM` flag, *and* has a component with `mutant` in its ID:
1. First, the item name is entirely replaced with "Mannwurst" if singular, or "Mannwursts" if plural.
2. Next, it is replaced by "sinister %s", but %s is replaced with the name as it was before this step, resulting in "sinister Mannwurst" or "sinister Mannwursts".

NB: If `"str_pl": "sinister %s"` wasn't specified, the plural form would be automatically created as "sinister %ss", which would become "sinister Mannwurstss" which is of course one S too far. Rule of thumb: If you are using %s in the name, always specify an identical plural form unless you know exactly what you're doing!


#### Color Key

When adding a new book, please use this color key:

* Magazines: `pink`
* “Paperbacks” Short enjoyment books (including novels): `light_cyan`
* “Hardbacks” Long enjoyment books (including novels): `light_blue`
* “Small textbook” Beginner level textbooks, guides and martial arts books: `green`
* “Large textbook” Advanced level textbooks and advanced guides: `blue`
* Religious books: `dark_gray`
* “Printouts” (including spiral-bound, binders, and similar) Technical documents, (technical?) protocols, (lab) journals, personal diaries: `light_green`
* Other reading material/non-books (use only if every other category does not apply): `light_gray`

A few exceptions to this color key may apply, for example for books that don’t are what they seem to be.
Never use `yellow` and `red`, those colors are reserved for sounds and infrared vision.

####CBMs

CBMs can be defined like this:

```C++
"type" : "BIONIC_ITEM",         // Defines this as a CBM
...                             // same entries as above for the generic item.
                                // additional some CBM specific entries:
"bionic_id" : "bio_advreactor", // ID of the installed bionic if not equivalent to "id"
"difficulty" : 11,              // Difficulty of installing CBM
"is_upgrade" : true             // Whether the CBM is an upgrade of another bionic.
```

### Comestibles

```C++
"type" : "COMESTIBLE",      // Defines this as a COMESTIBLE
...                         // same entries as above for the generic item.
                            // additional some comestible specific entries:
"addiction_type" : "crack", // Addiction type
"spoils_in" : 0,            // A time duration: how long a comestible is good for. 0 = no spoilage.
"use_action" : "CRACK",     // What effects a comestible has when used, see special definitions below
"stim" : 40,                // Stimulant effect
"comestible_type" : "MED",  // Comestible type, used for inventory sorting
"quench" : 0,               // Thirst quenched
"heal" : -2,                // Health effects (used for sickness chances)
"addiction_potential" : 80, // Ability to cause addictions
"monotony_penalty" : 0,     // (Optional, default: 2) Fun is reduced by this number for each one you've consumed in the last 48 hours.
                            // Can't drop fun below 0, unless the comestible also has the "NEGATIVE_MONOTONY_OK" flag.
"calories" : 0,             // Hunger satisfied (in kcal)
"nutrition" : 0,            // Hunger satisfied (OBSOLETE)
"tool" : "apparatus",       // Tool required to be eaten/drank
"charges" : 4,              // Number of uses when spawned
"stack_size" : 8,           // (Optional) How many uses are in the above-defined volume. If omitted, is the same as 'charges'
"fun" : 50                  // Morale effects when used
"freezing_point": 32,       // (Optional) Temperature in F at which item freezes, default is water (32F/0C)
"cooks_like": "meat_cooked" // (Optional) If the item is used in a recipe, replaces it with its cooks_like
"parasites": 10,            // (Optional) Probability of becoming parasitised when eating
"contamination": 5,         // (Optional) Probability to get food poisoning from this comestible. Values must be in the [0, 100] range.
```

### Containers

```C++
"type": "CONTAINER",  // Defines this as a container
...                   // same data as for the generic item (see above).
"contains": 200,      // How much volume this container can hold
"seals": false,       // Can be resealed, this is a required for it to be used for liquids. (optional, default: false)
"watertight": false,  // Can hold liquids, this is a required for it to be used for liquids. (optional, default: false)
"preserves": false,   // Contents do not spoil. (optional, default: false)
```
Alternately, every item can be used as container:
```C++
"type": "ARMOR",      // Any type is allowed here
...                   // same data as for the type
"container_data" : {  // The container specific data goes here.
    "contains": 200,
}
```
This defines a armor (you need to add all the armor specific entries), but makes it usable as container.
It could also be written as a generic item ("type": "GENERIC") with "armor_data" and "container_data" entries.

### Melee

```C++
"id": "hatchet",       // Unique ID. Must be one continuous word, use underscores if necessary

"ups_charges": 0,          // Additionally to the normal ammo (if any), a gun can require some charges from an UPS. This also works on mods. Attaching a mod with ups_charges will add/increase ups drain on the weapon.
"reload": 450,             // Amount of time to reload, 100 = 1 second = 1 "turn"
"built_in_mods": ["m203"], //An array of mods that will be integrated in the weapon using the IRREMOVABLE tag.
"default_mods": ["m203"]   //An array of mods that will be added to a weapon on spawn.
"barrel_length": "30 mL",  // Amount of volume lost when the barrel is sawn. Approximately 9mL per inch is a decent approximation.
```
Alternately, every item (book, tool, armor, even food) can be used as gun if it has gun_data:
```json
"type": "TOOL",      // Or any other item type
...                   // same entries as for the type (e.g. same entries as for any tool),
"gun_data" : {        // additionally the same gun data like above
    "skill": ...,
    "recoil": ...,
    ...
}
```

### Gunmod

Gun mods can be defined like this:

```C++
"type": "GUNMOD",              // Defines this as a GUNMOD
...                            // Same entries as above for the generic item.
                               // Additionally some gunmod specific entries:

```
Alternately, every item (book, tool, armor, even food) can be used as a gunmod if it has gunmod_data:
```
"type": "TOOL",       // Or any other item type
...                   // same entries as for the type (e.g. same entries as for any tool),
"gunmod_data" : {
    "location": ...,

}
```

### Batteries

```

### Seed Data

Every item type can have optional seed data, if the item has seed data, it's considered a seed and can be planted:

```C++
"seed_data" : {
    "fruits": "weed", // The item id of the fruits that this seed will produce.
    "seeds": false, // (optional, default is true). If true, harvesting the plant will spawn seeds (the same type as the item used to plant). If false only the fruits are spawned, no seeds.
    "fruit_div": 2, // (optional, default is 1). Final amount of fruit charges produced is divided by this number. Works only if fruit item is counted by charges.
    "byproducts": ["withered", "straw_pile"], // A list of further items that should spawn upon harvest.
    "plant_name": "sunflower", // The name of the plant that grows from this seed. This is only used as information displayed to the user.

                // Note that growing time is later converted based upon the season_length option, basing it around 91 is just for accuracy purposes
                // A value 91 means 3 full seasons, a value of 30 would mean 1 season.
}
```

### Artifact Data

Currently only vats can only accept and produce liquid items.

```C++
"brewable" : {
    "time": 3600, // A time duration: how long the fermentation will take.
    "result": "beer" // The id of the result of the fermentation.
}
```

### Software Data

Every item type can have software data, it does not have any behavior:

```C++
"software_data" : {
    "type": "USELESS", // unused
    "power" : 91 // unused
}
```

### Fuel data

Every item type can have fuel data that determines how much horse power it produces per unit consumed. Currently, gasses and plasmas cannot really be fuels.

If a fuel has the PERPETUAL flag, engines powered by it never use any fuel.  This is primarily intended for the muscle pseudo-fuel, but mods may take advantage of it to make perpetual motion machines.

```C++
"fuel" : {
    energy": 34.2,               // battery charges per mL of fuel. batteries have energy 1
                                 // is also MJ/L from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density
                                 // assumes stacksize 250 per volume 1 (250mL). Multiply
                                 // by 250 / stacksize * volume for other stack sizes and

###random Descriptions

Any item with a "snippet_category" entry will have random descriptions, based on that snippet category:
```
"snippet_category": "newspaper",
```
The item descriptions are taken from snippets, which can be specified like this (the value of category must match the snippet_category in the item definition):
```C++
{
    "type" : "snippet",
    "category" : "newspaper",
    "id" : "snippet-id",          // id is optional, it's used when the snippet is referenced in the item list of professions
    "text": "your flavor text"
}
```
or several snippets at once:
```C++
{
    "type" : "snippet",
    "category" : "newspaper",
    "text": [
        "your flavor text",
        "more flavor",
        // entries can also bo of this form to have a id to reference that specific snippet.
        { "id" : "snippet-id", "text" : "another flavor text" }
    ],
    "text": [ "your flavor text", "another flavor text", "more flavor" ]
}
```
Multiple snippets for the same category are possible and actually recommended. The game will select a random one for each item of that type.

One can also put the snippets directly in the item definition:
```
"snippet_category": [ "text 1", "text 2", "text 3" ],
```
This will automatically create a snippet category specific to that item and populate that category with the given snippets.
The format also support snippet ids like above.

# `json/` JSONs

  ]
},
```

#### `id`

Unique id of the harvest definition.

#### `type`

Should always be `harvest` to mark the object as a harvest definition.

#### `message`

Optional message to be printed when a creature using the harvest definition is butchered. May be omitted from definition.

#### `entries`

Array of dictionaries defining possible items produced on butchering and their likelihood of being produced.
`drop` value should be the `id` string of the item to be produced.

`type` value should be a string with the associated body part the item comes from.
    Acceptable values are as follows:
    `flesh`: the "meat" of the creature.
    `offal`: the "organs" of the creature. these are removed when field dressing.
    `skin`: the "skin" of the creature. this is what is ruined while quartering.
    `bone`: the "bones" of the creature. you will get some amount of these from field dressing, and the rest of them from butchering the carcass.
    `bionic`: an item gained by dissecting the creature. not restricted to CBMs.
    `bionic_group`: an item group that will give an item by dissecting a creature. not restricted to groups containing CBMs.

`flags` value should be an array of strings.  It's the flags that will be added to te items of that entry upon harvesting.

`faults` value should be an array of `fault_id` strings.  It's the faults that will be added to te items of that entry upon harvesting.

For every `type` other then `bionic` and `bionic_group` following entries scale the results:
    `base_num` value should be an array with two elements in which the first defines the minimum number of the corresponding item produced and the second defines the maximum number.
    `scale_num` value should be an array with two elements, increasing the minimum and maximum drop numbers respectively by element value * survival skill.
    `max` upper limit after `bas_num` and `scale_num` are calculated using  
    `mass_ratio` value is a multiplier of how much of the monster's weight comprises the associated item. to conserve mass, keep between 0 and 1 combined with all drops. This overrides `base_num`, `scale_num` and `max`


For `type`s: `bionic` and `bionic_group` following enrties can scale the results:
    `max` this value (in contrary to `max` for other `type`s) corresponds to maximum butchery roll that will be passed to check_butcher_cbm() in activity_handlers.cpp; view check_butcher_cbm() to see corresponding distribution chances for roll values passed to that function

### Furniture

```C++
{
    "type": "furniture",

    "examine_action": "workbench",
    "workbench": { "multiplier": 1.1, "mass": 10000, "volume": "50L" }

#### `type`

Fixed string, must be `furniture` to identify the JSON object as such.

`"id", "name", "symbol", "looks_like", "color", "bgcolor", "max_volume", "open", "close", "bash", "deconstruct", "examine_action", "flgs`

Same as for terrain, see below in the chapter "Common to furniture and terrain".

#### `move_cost_mod`

Movement cost modifier (`-10` = impassable, `0` = no change). This is added to the movecost of the underlying terrain.

#### `light_emitted`

How much light the furniture produces.  10 will light the tile it's on brightly, 15 will light that tile and the tiles around it brightly, as well as slightly lighting the tiles two tiles away from the source.
For examples: An overhead light is 120, a utility light, 240, and a console, 10.

#### `required_str`

Strength required to move the furniture around. Negative values indicate an unmovable furniture.

#### `crafting_pseudo_item`

(Optional) Id of an item (tool) that will be available for crafting when this furniture is range (the furniture acts as an item of that type).

#### `workbench`

(Optional) Can craft here.  Must specify a speed multiplier, allowed mass, and allowed volume.  Mass/volume over these limits incur a speed penalty.  Must be paired with a `"workbench"` `examine_action` to function.

#### `plant_data`

(Optional) This is a plant. Must specify a plant transform, and a base depending on context. You can also add a harvest or growth multiplier if it has the `GROWTH_HARVEST` flag. 

### Terrain

```C++
{
    "type": "terrain",
    "id": "t_spiked_pit",
    "name": "spiked pit",
    "symbol": "0",
    "looks_like": "pit",
    "color": "ltred",
    "move_cost": 10,
    "light_emitted": 10,
    "trap": "spike_pit",
    "max_volume": "1000 L",
    "flags": ["TRANSPARENT", "DIGGABLE"],
    "connects_to" : "WALL",
    "close": "t_foo_closed",
    "open": "t_foo_open",
    "bash": "TODO",
    "deconstruct": "TODO",
    "harvestable": "blueberries",
    "transforms_into": "t_tree_harvested",
    "harvest_season": "WINTER",
    "roof": "t_roof",
    "examine_action": "pit"
}
```

#### `type`

Fixed string, must be "terrain" to identify the JSON object as such.

`"id", "name", "symbol", "looks_like", "color", "bgcolor", "max_volume", "open", "close", "bash", "deconstruct", "examine_action", "flgs`

Same as for furniture, see below in the chapter "Common to furniture and terrain".

#### `move_cost`

Move cost to move through. A value of 0 means it's impassable (e.g. wall). You should not use negative values. The positive value is multiple of 50 move points, e.g. value 2 means the player uses 2\*50 = 100 move points when moving across the terrain.

#### `light_emitted`

How much light the terrain emits. 10 will light the tile it's on brightly, 15 will light that tile and the tiles around it brightly, as well as slightly lighting the tiles two tiles away from the source.
For examples: An overhead light is 120, a utility light, 240, and a console, 10.

#### `trap`

(Optional) Id of the build-in trap of that terrain.

For example the terrain `t_pit` has the built-in trap `tr_pit`. Every tile in the game that has the terrain `t_pit` also has, therefore, an implicit trap `tr_pit` on it. The two are inseparable (the player can not deactivate the built-in trap, and changing the terrain will also deactivate the built-in trap).

A built-in trap prevents adding any other trap explicitly (by the player and through mapgen).

#### `harvestable`

(Optional) If defined, the terrain is harvestable. This entry defines the item type of the harvested fruits (or similar). To make this work, you also have to set one of the `harvest_*` `examine_action` functions.

#### `transforms_into`

(Optional) Used for various transformation of the terrain. If defined, it must be a valid terrain id. Used for example:

- When harvesting fruits (to change into the harvested form of the terrain).
- In combination with the `HARVESTED` flag and `harvest_season` to change the harvested terrain back into a terrain with fruits.

#### `harvest_season`

(Optional) On of "SUMMER", "AUTUMN", "WINTER", "SPRING", used in combination with the "HARVESTED" flag to revert the terrain back into a terrain that can be harvested.

#### `roof`

(Optional) The terrain of the terrain on top of this (the roof).

### Common To Furniture And Terrain

Some values can/must be set for terrain and furniture. They have the same meaning in each case.

#### `id`

Id of the object, this should be unique among all object of that type (all terrain or all furniture types). By convention (but technically not needed), the id should have the "f_" prefix for furniture and the "t_" prefix for terrain. This is not translated. It must not be changed later as that would break save compatibility.

#### `name`

Displayed name of the object. This will be translated.

#### `flags`

(Optional) Various additional flags, see "doc/JSON_FLAGS.md".

#### `connects_to`

(Optional) The group of terrains to which this terrain connects. This affects tile rotation and connections, and the ASCII symbol drawn by terrain with the flag "AUTO_WALL_SYMBOL".

Current values:
- `CHAINFENCE`
- `RAILING`
- `WALL`
- `WATER`
- `WOODFENCE`

Example: `-` , `|` , `X` and `Y` are terrain which share the same `connects_to` value. `O` does not have it. `X` and `Y` also have the `AUTO_WALL_SYMBOL` flag. `X` will be drawn as a T-intersection (connected to west, south and east), `Y` will be drawn as a horizontal line (going from west to east, no connection to south).

```
-X-    -Y-
 |      O
```

#### `symbol`

ASCII symbol of the object as it appears in the game. The symbol string must be exactly one character long. This can also be an array of 4 strings, which define the symbol during the different seasons. The first entry defines the symbol during spring. If it's not an array, the same symbol is used all year round.

#### `comfort`

How comfortable this terrain/furniture is. Impact ability to fall asleep on it.
    uncomfortable = -999,
    neutral = 0,
    slightly_comfortable = 3,
    comfortable = 5,
    very_comfortable = 10

#### `floor_bedding_warmth`

Bonus warmth offered by this terrain/furniture when used to sleep. 

#### `bonus_fire_warmth_feet`

Increase warmth received on feet from nearby fire  (default = 300)

#### `looks_like`

id of a similar item that this item looks like. The tileset loader will try to load the tile for that item if this item doesn't have a tile. looks_like entries are implicitly chained, so if 'throne' has looks_like 'big_chair' and 'big_chair' has looks_like 'chair', a throne will be displayed using the chair tile if tiles for throne and big_chair do not exist. If a tileset can't find a tile for any item in the looks_like chain, it will default to the ascii symbol.

#### `color` or `bgcolor`

Color of the object as it appears in the game. "color" defines the foreground color (no background color), "bgcolor" defines a solid background color. As with the "symbol" value, this can be an array with 4 entries, each entry being the color during the different seasons.

> **NOTE**: You must use ONLY ONE of "color" or "bgcolor"

#### `max_volume`

(Optional) Maximal volume that can be used to store items here. Volume in ml and L can be used - "50 ml" or "2 L"

#### `examine_action`

(Optional) The json function that is called when the object is examined. See "src/iexamine.h".

#### `close" And "open`

(Optional) The value should be a terrain id (inside a terrain entry) or a furniture id (in a furniture entry). If either is defined, the player can open / close the object. Opening / closing will change the object at the affected tile to the given one. For example one could have object "safe_c", which "open"s to "safe_o" and "safe_o" in turn "close"s to "safe_c". Here "safe_c" and "safe_o" are two different terrain (or furniture) types that have different properties.

#### `bash`

(Optional) Defines whether the object can be bashed and if so, what happens. See "map_bash_info".

#### `deconstruct`

(Optional) Defines whether the object can be deconstructed and if so, what the results shall be. See "map_deconstruct_info".

#### `map_bash_info`

Defines the various things that happen when the player or something else bashes terrain or furniture.

```C++
{
    "str_min": 80,
    "str_max": 180,
    "str_min_blocked": 15,
    "str_max_blocked": 100,

    "tent_centers": ["f_groundsheet", "f_fema_groundsheet", "f_skin_groundsheet"],
    "items": "bashed_item_result_group"
}
```

#### `str_min`, `str_max`, `str_min_blocked`, `str_max_blocked`, `str_min_supported`, `str_max_supported`

TODO

#### `sound`, `sound_fail`, `sound_vol`, `sound_fail_vol`
(Optional) Sound and volume of the sound that appears upon destroying the bashed object or upon unsuccessfully bashing it (failing). The sound strings are translated (and displayed to the player).

#### `furn_set`, `ter_set`

The terrain / furniture that will be set when the original is destroyed. This is mandatory for bash entries in terrain, but optional for entries in furniture (it defaults to no furniture).

#### `explosive`
(Optional) If greater than 0, destroying the object causes an explosion with this strength (see `game::explosion`).

#### `destroy_only`
TODO

#### `bash_below`
TODO

#### `tent_centers`, `collapse_radius`
(Optional) For furniture that is part of tents, this defines the id of the center part, which will be destroyed as well when other parts of the tent get bashed. The center is searched for in the given "collapse_radius" radius, it should match the size of the tent.

#### `items`

(Optional) An item group (inline) or an id of an item group, see doc/ITEM_SPAWN.md. The default subtype is "collection". Upon successful bashing, items from that group will be spawned.

#### `map_deconstruct_info`

```C++
{
    "furn_set": "f_safe",
    "ter_set": "t_dirt",
    "items": "deconstructed_item_result_group"
}
```

#### `furn_set`, `ter_set`

The terrain / furniture that will be set after the original has been deconstructed. "furn_set" is optional (it defaults to no furniture), "ter_set" is only used upon "deconstruct" entries in terrain and is mandatory there.

### `items`

(Optional) An item group (inline) or an id of an item group, see doc/ITEM_SPAWN.md. The default subtype is "collection". Upon deconstruction the object, items from that group will be spawned.

### `plant_data`

```JSON
{
  "transform": "f_planter_harvest",
  "base": "f_planter",
  "growth_multiplier": 1.2,
  "harvest_multiplier": 0.8
}
```

#### `transform`

What the `PLANT` furniture turn into when it grows a stage, or what a `PLANTABLE` furniture turns into when it is planted on.

#### `base`

What the 'base' furniture of the `PLANT` furniture is - what it would be if there was not a plant growing there. Used when monsters 'eat' the plant to preserve what furniture it is.

#### `growth_multiplier`

A flat multiplier on the growth speed on the plant. For numbers greater than one, it will take longer to grow, and for numbers less than one it will take less time to grow.

#### `harvest_multiplier`

A flat multiplier on the harvest count of the plant. For numbers greater than one, the plant will give more produce from harvest, for numbers less than one it will give less produce from harvest.

### clothing_mod

```JSON
"type": "clothing_mod",
"id": "leather_padded",   // Unique ID.
"flag": "leather_padded", // flag to add to clothing.
"item": "leather",        // item to consume.
"implement_prompt": "Pad with leather",      // prompt to show when implement mod.
"destroy_prompt": "Destroy leather padding", // prompt to show when destroy mod.
"restricted": true,       // (optional) If true, clothing must list this mod's flag in "valid_mods" list to use it. Defaults to false.
"mod_value": [            // List of mod effect.
    {
        "type": "bash",   // "bash", "cut", "fire", "acid", "warmth", "storage", and "encumbrance" is available.
        "value": 1,       // value of effect.
        "round_up": false // (optional) round up value of effect. defaults to false.
        "proportion": [   // (optional) value of effect propotions to clothing's parameter.
            "thickness",  //            "thickness" and "coverage" is available.
            "coverage"
        ]
    }
]
```

# Scenarios

Scenarios are specified as JSON object with `type` member set to `scenario`.

```C++
{
    "type": "scenario",
    "ident": "schools_out",
    ...
}
```

The ident member should be the unique id of the scenario.

The following properties (mandatory, except if noted otherwise) are supported:


## `description`
(string)

The in-game description.

## `name`
(string or object with members "male" and "female")

The in-game name, either one gender-neutral string, or an object with gender specific names. Example:
```C++
"name": {
    "male": "Runaway groom",
    "female": "Runaway bride"
}
```

## `points`
(integer)

Point cost of scenario. Positive values cost points and negative values grant points.

## `items`
(optional, object with optional members "both", "male" and "female")

Items the player starts with when selecting this scenario. One can specify different items based on the gender of the character. Each lists of items should be an array of items ids. Ids may appear multiple times, in which case the item is created multiple times.

Example:
```C++
"items": {
    "both": [
        "pants",
        "rock",
        "rock"
    ],
    "male": [ "briefs" ],
    "female": [ "panties" ]
}
```
This gives the player pants, two rocks and (depending on the gender) briefs or panties.

Mods can modify the lists of an existing scenario via "add:both" / "add:male" / "add:female" and "remove:both" / "remove:male" / "remove:female".

Example for mods:
```C++
{
    "type": "scenario",
    "ident": "schools_out",
    "edit-mode": "modify",
    "items": {
        "remove:both": [ "rock" ],
        "add:female": [ "2x4" ]
    }
}
```

## `flags`
(optional, array of strings)

A list of flags. TODO: document those flags here.

Mods can modify this via "add:flags" and "remove:flags".

## `cbms`
(optional, array of strings)

A list of CBM ids that are implanted in the character.

Mods can modify this via "add:CBMs" and "remove:CBMs".

## `traits", "forced_traits", "forbidden_traits`
(optional, array of strings)

Lists of trait/mutation ids. Traits in "forbidden_traits" are forbidden and can't be selected during the character creation. Traits in "forced_traits" are automatically added to character. Traits in "traits" enables them to be chosen, even if they are not starting traits.

Mods can modify this via "add:traits" / "add:forced_traits" / "add:forbidden_traits" and "remove:traits" / "remove:forced_traits" / "remove:forbidden_traits".

## `allowed_locs`
(optional, array of strings)

A list of starting location ids (see start_locations.json) that can be chosen when using this scenario.

## `start_name`
(string)

The name that is shown for the starting location. This is useful if the scenario allows several starting locations, but the game can not list them all at once in the scenario description. Example: if the scenario allows to start somewhere in the wilderness, the starting locations would contain forest and fields, but its "start_name" may simply be "wilderness".

## `professions`
(optional, array of strings)

A list of allowed professions that can be chosen when using this scenario. The first entry is the default profession. If this is empty, all professions are allowed.

## `map_special`
(optional, string)

Add a map special to the starting location, see JSON_FLAGS for the possible specials.

## `missions`
(optional, array of strings)

A list of mission ids that will be started and assigned to the player at the start of the game. Only missions with the ORIGIN_GAME_START origin are allowed. The last mission in the list will be the active mission, if multiple missions are assigned.

# Starting locations

Starting locations are specified as JSON object with "type" member set to "start_location":
```C++
{
    "type": "start_location",
    "ident": "field",
    "name": "An empty field",
    "target": "field",
    ...
}
```

The ident member should be the unique id of the location.

The following properties (mandatory, except if noted otherwise) are supported:

## `name`
(string)

The in-game name of the location.

## `target`
(string)

The id of an overmap terrain type (see overmap_terrain.json) of the starting location. The game will chose a random place with that terrain.

## `flags`
(optional, array of strings)

Arbitrary flags. Mods can modify this via "add:flags" / "remove:flags". TODO: document them.

### `tile_config`
Each tileset has a tile_config.json describing how to map the contents of a sprite sheet to various tile identifiers, different orientations, etc. The ordering of the overlays used for displaying mutations can be controlled as well. The ordering can be used to override the default ordering provided in `mutation_ordering.json`. Example:

```C++
  {                                             // whole file is a single object
    "tile_info": [                              // tile_info is mandatory
      {
        "height": 32,
        "width": 32,
        "iso" : true,                             //  Optional. Indicates an isometric tileset. Defaults to false.
        "pixelscale" : 2                          //  Optional. Sets a multiplier for resizing a tileset. Defaults to 1.
      }
    ],
    "tiles-new": [                              // tiles-new is an array of sprite sheets
      {                                           //   alternately, just one "tiles" array
        "file": "tiles.png",                      // file containing sprites in a grid
        "tiles": [                                // array with one entry per tile
          {
            "id": "10mm",                         // id is how the game maps things to sprites

  }
```

# Mutation overlay ordering

The file `mutation_ordering.json` defines the order that visual mutation and bionic overlays are rendered on a character ingame. The layering value from 0 (bottom) - 9999 (top) sets the order.

Example:
```C++
[
    {
        "type" : "overlay_order",
        "overlay_ordering" :
        [
        {
            "id" : [ "BEAUTIFUL", "BEAUTIFUL2", "BEAUTIFUL3", "LARGE", "PRETTY", "RADIOACTIVE1", "RADIOACTIVE2", "RADIOACTIVE3", "REGEN" ],
            "order" : 1000
        },{

## `id`
(string)

The internal ID of the mutation. Can be provided as a single string, or an array of strings. The order value provided will be applied to all items in the array.

## `order`
(integer)

The ordering value of the mutation overlay. Values range from 0 - 9999, 9999 being the topmost drawn layer. Mutations that are not in any list will default to 9999.

# MOD tileset

MOD tileset defines additional sprite sheets. It is specified as JSON object with `type` member set to `mod_tileset`.

Example:
```C++
[
    {
    "type": "mod_tileset",
    "compatibility": [ "MshockXottoplus" ],
    "tiles-new": [
        {
        "file": "test_tile.png",
        "tiles": [
            {
            "id": "player_female",
            "fg": 1,
            "bg": 0
            },
            {
            "id": "player_male",
            "fg": 2,
            "bg": 0
            }
        ]
        }
    ]
    }
]
```

## `compatibility`
(string)

The internal ID of the compatible tilesets. MOD tileset is only applied when base tileset's ID exists in this field.

## `tiles-new`

Setting of sprite sheets. Same as `tiles-new` field in `tile_config`. Sprite files are loaded from the same folder json file exists.
