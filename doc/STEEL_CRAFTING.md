# Making and working with steel grades



# Defining Steel Grades

Steel is an extremely versatile resource. In Catacylsm: Dark Days Ahead, we use a very simplified system of steel grades, roughly based on the SAE International grading. In general, a carbon steel is iron with a specific amount of carbon added. While other steel alloys may add additional materials or treat the steel in various ways to produce different results, carbon steels are the workhorses of the modern world.

### Slag

Slag is a byproduct of metalworking, generally representing impurities in the ore used to create the steel. It does have some uses IRL, but is generally an unplesant toxic substance that is difficult to get rid of.

### Budget Steel

Budget Steel represents poorly made steel that contains impurities, rusts easily, fractures, and generally isn't very useful. This should be used to represent things like a Genuine Katana From Nippon that was sold on craigslist for $50, or to represent things like armor that's been sitting in a mansion for two hundred years without maintenance. 

### Mild Carbon Steel

Aproximates SAE 1010, a 0.1% carbon steel with no slag content. Mild (or low) carbon steel is the simplest version of steel that a player can craft. Despite the name, it is a tough substance with many uses. Due to the relative ease of production, many weapons and armors can use mild steel.

### Medium Carbon Steel

Aproximates SAE 1050, a 0.5% carbon steel with no slag. This is commonly used in industrial applications, large machinery, automobile parts, and softer metalworking tools.

### High Carbon Steel

Approximates SAE 1085, a 0.85% carbon steel with no slag. This is a particularly hard steel, often used in metalworking and high strength applications like bladed tools, heavy-duty wires and cables. Higher carbon content than this becomes extremely difficult to work outside of a survivor's garage workshop.

### Case Hardened Carbon Steel

Case hardening (also known as face hardening) is an old process used to improve mild steels. The steel is sealed in a container which is packed tightly with high carbon substances (ground charoal or coal is ideal). It is then heated to ~900°C for several hours, releasing carbon monoxide which binds with the steel which is in a transitioning phase at that temperature. The process forms a higher carbon case around the softer steel core, allowing for a hard surface that can hold an edge well with a softer center to prevent fracturing.

### Quench Tempered Carbon Steel

Tempering (specifically, Martenesitic transformation) is a process of hardening the steel by heating it to just under ~900°C and then rapidly cooled in water. This results in an extremely hard crystaline structure forming within the steel, making this one of the toughest subtances a survivor can create.

# Making Steel

### Tools

Aside from standard tools for working and shaping metal, steel requires not only high heat, but carefully controlled heat, maintained for hours in some cases. This partially accounts for the long craft times of steel items. Gas or electric forges are ideal for a survivor. Carbon is a critical component of *carbon* steels, but is readily available as long as one has trees to convert to charcoal.

### Upgrades

Mild steel can be 'raised' to medium steel, and medium to high steel. These recipes exist in the game for lumps and chunks. Mild steel can be hardened and medium steel can be tempered, but neither of these would be done to an ingot of metal that would then later be worked. Instead a hardened or tempered item should be crafted from scratch or by using a mild/medium steel item and upgrading it to a higher type of steel.

### Repairing

Most metal repairs in Catacylsm simply use a welder with the associated fuel costs and an amount of a similar material, representing cutting and replacing or layering new material over old. While this is high abstracted, we don't have a more detailed repair model. For mild, medium, and high steel, this is sufficient. Case hardened steel should properly be re-cased after a repair, which is difficult to manage IRL and often it would be easier to reforge the item. Tempered steel can be welded, but is a much more complicated process: the metal must be heated to the temperature it was tempered at, the new material added, then the entire area is wrapped in insulation for equal cooling. To this effect, an insulated welding blanket has been added, allowing the wrap. However, the repair time is greatly condensed as the cooling process alone can take hours.
