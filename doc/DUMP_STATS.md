# Statistics reports

The program binary can be executed with the `dump-stats` command line argument
using the syntax `--dump-stats <what> [mode]`. Both TSV and HTML output modes
are supported. For each report the game creates a default instance of each
object (inclusive of any default ammo, contents or mods).

The following output reports are supported:

* AMMO
* EDIBLE
* GUN
* VEHICLE
* VPART
