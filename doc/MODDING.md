# Modding guide

Certain features of the game can be modified without rebuilding the game from source code; you should be able to just modify the pertinent files and run the game to see your changes.  This attempts to document these features.

An in-depth review of all json files and their appropriate fields is available in JSON_INFO.txt.

## Adding a profession.

Let's say we want to add a "survivalist" profession.

We'll say this profession starts with archery, survival, traps, beef jerky and a few survival items.  We'll set the starting cost at 3 points since it modifies skills and items.  We could do that with the following entries:

````json
{
  "ident" : "survivalist",
  "name": "Wilderness Survivalist",
  "description": "You live off the wild and wander the world; you've never
                  had a place to live or items other than what you can
                  scavenge off the land.  People called you crazy; now,
                  after the disaster, you're the sane one.",

  "points" : 3,
  "items": ["pants_cargo", "boots", "beltrig", "selfbow", "jerky", "arrow_field_point"],

 "skills" : [
     {
        "name": "archery",
        "level" : 1
     },
     {
        "name" : "survival",
        "level" : 1
     },
     {
        "name" : "traps",
        "level" : 1
     }
 ]
},
````

After adding this to the professions.json file, we should see the new profession show up in the character creation screen.

## Adding an item
1.  Open the appropriate json in `data/json/items` and add your item near similar types.

> **NOTE:** See `JSON_INFO` for a more in-depth review of each individual item .json file/flags

2.  Add the item to `data/json/itemgroups` to have it spawn in in-game locations

## Important note on json files

The following characters: `[ { , } ] : "` are *very* important when adding or modifying the JSON files for technical reasons.  This means a single missing `,` or `[` or `}` can be the difference between a working file and a hanging game at startup.

Many editors have features that let you track `{ [` and `] }` to see if they're balanced (ie, have a matching opposite); [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is a popular, free editor on Windows that contains this feature.  On Linux, there are a plethora of options, and you probably already have a preferred one ðŸ™‚
