TODO: document the "npc" structure, used to load NPC template

# Writing dialogues
Dialogues work like state machines. They start with a certain topic (the NPC says something), the player character can respond (choosing one of several responses), and that response sets the new talk topic. This goes on until the dialogue is finished, or the NPC turns hostile.

Note that it is perfectly fine to have a response that switches the topic back to itself.

NPC missions are controlled by a seperate but related JSON structure and are documented in
MISSIONS_JSON.md.

Two topics are special:
- "TALK_DONE" ends the dialogue immediately.
- "TALK_NONE" goes to the previously talked about topic.

## Talk topics

Each topic consists of:
1. a topic id (e.g. "TALK_ARSONIST")
2. a dynamic line, spoken by the NPC.
3. a list of responses that can be spoken by the player character.

One can specify new topics in json. It is currently not possible to define the starting topic, so you have to add a response to some of the default topics (e.g. "TALK_STRANGER_FRIENDLY" or "TALK_STRANGER_NEUTRAL") or to topics that can be reached somehow.

Format:
```C++
{
    "type": "talk_topic",
    "id": "TALK_ARSONIST",
    "dynamic_line": "What now?",
    "responses": [
        {
            "text": "I don't know either",
            "topic": "TALK_DONE"
        }
    ],
    "replace_built_in_responses": true
}
```
### type
Must always be there and must always be `"talk_topic"`.

### id
The topic id can be one of the built-in topics or a new id. However, if several talk topics *in json* have the same id, the last topic definition will override the previous ones.

The topic id can also be an array of strings. This is loaded as if several topics with the exact same content have been given in json, each associated with an id from the `id`, array. Note that loading from json will append responses and, if defined in json, override the `dynamic_line` and the `replace_built_in_responses` setting. This allows adding responses to several topics at once.

This example adds the "I'm going now!" response to all the listed topics.
```C++
{
    "type": "talk_topic",
    "id": [ "TALK_ARSONIST", "TALK_STRANGER_FRIENDLY", "TALK_STRANGER_NEUTRAL" ],
    "dynamic_line": "What now?",
    "responses": [
        {
            "text": "I'm going now.",
            "topic": "TALK_DONE"
        }
    ]
}
```

### dynamic_line
The `dynamic_line` is the line spoken by the NPC.  It is optional.  If it is not defined and the topic has the same id as a built-in topic, the `dynamic_line` from that built-in topic will be used.  Otherwise the NPC will say nothing.  See the chapter about dynamic_line below for more details.

### response
The `responses` entry is an array with possible responses.  It must not be empty.  Each entry must be a response object. See the chapter about Responses below for more details.

### replace_built_in_responses
`replace_built_in_responses` is an optional boolean that defines whether to dismiss the built-in responses for that topic (default is `false`). If there are no built-in responses, this won't do anything. If `true`, the built-in responses are ignored and only those from this definition in the current json are used. If `false`, the responses from the current json are used along with the built-in responses (if any).

---

## dynamic_line
A dynamic line can either be a simple string, or an complex object, or an array with `dynamic_line` entries.  If it's an array, an entry will be chosen randomly every time the NPC needs it.  Each entry has the same probability.

Example:
```C++
"dynamic_line": [
    "generic text",
    {
        "npc_female": [ "text1", "text2", "text3" ],
        "npc_male": { "u_female": "text a", "u_male": "text b" }
    }
]
```

A complex `dynamic_line` usually contains several `dynamic_line` entry and some condition that determines which is used.  If dynamic lines are not nested, they are processed in the order of the entries below.  The possible types of lines follow.

In all cases, `npc_` refers to the NPC, and `u_` refers to the player.  Optional lines do not have to be defined, but the NPC should always have something to say.  Entries are always parsed as `dynamic_line` and can be nested.

#### Several lines joined together
The dynamic line is a list of dynamic lines, all of which are displayed.  The dynamic lines in the list are processed normally.
```C++
{
    "and": [
        {
            "npc_male": true,
            "yes": "I'm a man.",
            "no": "I'm a woman."
        },
        "  ",
        {
            "u_female": true,
            "no": "You're a man.",
            "yes": "You're a woman."
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Based on whether the NPC has missions available
The dynamic line is chosen based on whether the NPC has any missions to give out.  All entries are optional.  The line from `many` will be shown in the NPC has two or more missions to assign to the player, the line from `one` will be shown if the NPC has one mission available, and otherwise the line from `none` will be shown.

```C++
{
    "npc_has_mission": true,
    "many": "There are lots of things you could do to help.",
    "one": "There's one thing you could do to help.",
    "none": "You've cleaned this place up!"
}
```

#### Based on whether the player character is performing missions for the NPC
The dynamic line is chosen based on whether the player character is performing any missions for the NPC.  All entries are optional.  The line from `many` if the player character is performing two or more missions for the NPC, the line from `one` will be shown if the player is performing one mission, and otherwise the line from `none` will be shown.

```C++
{
    "u_has_mission": true,
    "many": "You're doing so much for this town!",
    "one": "It looks like you have some spare time.",
    "none": "Since you're not doing anything important, I have a favor to ask."
}
```

#### Based on whether the player character or NPC are driving vehicles or not
The dynamic line is chosen if the player is driving a vehicle, or the NPC is driving a vehicle, or if neither are driving vehicles.  The line from `u_driving` is chosen if the player is in control of a vehicle, the line from `npc_driving` is chosen if the NPC is in control of a vehicle, and the line from `no_vehicle` is chosen if neither are controlling a vehicle.

**NOTE**: NPCs can't drive vehicles right now.

```C++
{
    "u_driving": "I said take a left at Albequerque!",
    "npc_driving": "Who died and put me behind the wheel?",
    "no_vehicle": "This is a good time to chat."
}
```

#### Based on the day/night cycle
The dynamic line is chosen based whether it is currently daytime or nighttime.  Both entries must exist.

```C++
{
    "is_day": "Sure is bright out.",
    "is_night": "Look at the moon."
}
```

#### A randomly selected hint
The dynamic line will be randomly chosen from the hints snippets.

```C++
{
    "give_hint": true
}
```

#### Based on any Dialogue condition
The dynamic line will be chosen based on whether a single dialogue condition is true or false.  Dialogue conditions cannot be chained via `"and"`, `"or"`, or `"not"`.  If the condition is true, the `"yes"` response will be chosen and otherwise the `"no"` response will be chosen.  Both the `'"yes"` and `"no"` reponses are optional.  Simple string conditions must be followed by `"true"` to make them fields in the dynamic line dictionary.

```C++
{
    "npc_need": "fatigue",
    "level": "TIRED",
    "no": "Just few minutes more...",
    "yes": "Make it quick, I want to go back to sleep."
}
{
    "npc_aim_rule": "AIM_PRECISE",
    "no": "*will not bother to aim at all.",
    "yes": "*will take time and aim carefully."
}
{
    "u_has_item": "india_pale_ale",
    "yes": "<noticedbooze>",
    "no": "<neutralchitchat>"
}
{
    "days_since_cataclysm": 30,
    "yes": "Now, we've got a moment, I was just thinking it's been a month or so since... since all this, how are you coping with it all?",
    "no": "<neutralchitchat>"
} 
```
---

## Responses
A response contains at least a text, which is display to the user and "spoken" by the player character (its content has no meaning for the game) and a topic to which the dialogue will switch to. It can also have a trial object which can be used to either lie, persuade or intimidate the NPC, see below for details. There can be different results, used either when the trial succeeds and when it fails.

Format:
```C++
{
    "text": "I, the player, say to you...",
    "condition": "...something...",
    "trial": {
        "type": "PERSUADE",
        "difficulty": 10
    },
    "success": {
        "topic": "TALK_DONE",
        "effect": "...",
        "opinion": {
            "trust": 0,
            "fear": 0,
            "value": 0,
            "anger": 0,
            "owed": 0,
            "favors": 0
        }
    },
    "failure": {
        "topic": "TALK_DONE"
    }
}
```

Alternatively a short format:
```C++
{
    "text": "I, the player, say to you...",
    "effect": "...",
    "topic": "TALK_WHATEVER"
}
```
The short format is equivalent to (an unconditional switching of the topic, `effect` is optional):
```C++
{
    "text": "I, the player, say to you...",
    "trial": {
        "type": "NONE"
    },
    "success": {
        "effect": "...",
        "topic": "TALK_WHATEVER"
    }
}
```

The optional boolean keys "switch" and "default" are false by default.  Only the first response with `"switch": true`, `"default": false`, and a valid condition will be displayed, and no other responses with `"switch": true` will be displayed.  If no responses with `"switch": true` and `"default":  false` are displayed, then any and all responses with `"switch": true` and `"default": true` will be displayed.  In either case, all responses that have `"switch": false` (whether or not they have `"default": true` is set) will be displayed as long their conditions are satisifed.

#### switch and default Example
```C++
"responses": [
  { "text": "You know what, never mind.", "topic": "TALK_NONE" },
  { "text": "How does 5 Ben Franklins sound?",
    "topic": "TALK_BIG_BRIBE", "condition": { "u_has_cash": 500 }, "switch": true },
   { "text": "I could give you a big Grant.",
    "topic": "TALK_BRIBE", "condition": { "u_has_cash": 50 }, "switch": true },
  { "text": "Lincoln liberated the slaves, what can he do for me?",
    "topic": "TALK_TINY_BRIBE", "condition": { "u_has_cash": 5 }, "switch": true, "default": true },
  { "text": "Maybe we can work something else out?", "topic": "TALK_BRIBE_OTHER",
    "switch": true, "default": true },
  { "text": "Gotta go!", "topic": "TALK_DONE" }
]
```
The player will always have the option to return to a previous topic or end the conversation, and
will otherwise have the option to give a $500, $50, or $5 bribe if they have the funds.  If they
don't have at least $50, they will also have the option to provide some other bribe.

### truefalsetext
The player will have one response text if a condition is true, and another if it is false, but the same trial for either line.  `condition`, `true`, and `false` are all mandatory.

```C++
{
    "truefalsetext": {
        "condition": { "u_has_cash": 800 },
        "true": "I may have the money, I'm not giving you any.",
        "false": "I don't have that money."
    },
    "topic": "TALK_WONT_PAY"
}
```

### text
Will be shown to the user, no further meaning.

### trial
Optional, if not defined, "NONE" is used. Otherwise one of "NONE", "LIE", "PERSUADE" "INTIMIDATE", or "CONDITION". If "NONE" is used, the `failure` object is not read, otherwise it's mandatory.

The `difficulty` is only required if type is not "NONE" or "CONDITION" and specifies the success chance in percent (it is however modified by various things like mutations).  Higher difficulties are easier to pass.

An optional `mod` array takes any of the following modifiers and increases the difficulty by the NPC's opinion of your character or personality trait for that modifier multiplied by the value: "ANGER", "FEAR", "TRUST", "VALUE", "AGRESSION", "ALTRUISM", "BRAVERY", "COLLECTOR". The special "POS_FEAR" modifier treats NPC's fear of your character below 0 as though it were 0.  The special "TOTAL" modifier sums all previous modifiers and then multiplies the result by its value and is used when setting the owed value.

"CONDITION" trials take a mandatory `condition` instead of `difficulty`.  The `success` object is chosen if the `condition` is true and the `failure` is chosen otherwise.

### success and failure
Both objects have the same structure. `topic` defines which topic the dialogue will switch to. `opinion` is optional, if given it defines how the opinion of the NPC will change. The given values are *added* to the opinion of the NPC, they are all optional and default to 0. `effect` is a function that is executed after choosing the response, see below.

The opinion of the NPC affects several aspects of the interaction with NPCs:
- Higher trust makes it easier to lie and persuade, and it usually a good thing.
- Higher fear makes it easier to intimidate, but the NPC may flee from you (and will not talk to you).
- Higher value makes it easier to persuade them and to give them orders, it's a kind of a friendship indicator.
- High anger value (about 20 points more than fear, but this also depends on the NPCs personality) makes the NPC hostile and is usually a bad thing.
The combination of fear and trust decide together with the personality of the NPC the initial talk topic ("TALK_MUG", "TALK_STRANGER_AGGRESSIVE", "TALK_STRANGER_SCARED", "TALK_STRANGER_WARY", "TALK_STRANGER_FRIENDLY" or "TALK_STRANGER_NEUTRAL").

For the actual usage of that data, search the source code for "op_of_u".

The `failure` object is used if the trial fails, the `success` object is used otherwise.

### Sample trials
"trial": { "type": "PERSUADE", "difficulty": 0, "mod": [ [ "TRUST", 3 ], [ "VALUE", 3 ], [ "ANGER", -3 ] ] }
"trial": { "type": "INTIMIDATE", "difficulty": 20, "mod": [ [ "FEAR", 8 ], [ "VALUE", 2 ], [ "TRUST", 2 ], [ "BRAVERY", -2 ] ] }
"trial": { "type": "CONDITION", "condition": { "npc_has_trait": "FARMER" } }

`topic` can also be a single topic object (the `type` member is not required here):
```C++
"success": {
    "topic": {
        "id": "TALK_NEXT",
        "dynamic_line": "...",
        "responses": [
        ]
    }
}
```

### condition
This is an optional condition which can be used to prevent the response under certain circumstances. If not defined, it defaults to always `true`. If the condition is not met, the response is not included in the list of possible responses. For possible content see Dialogue Conditions below.

```

#### `mission_opinion`: { }
trust, value, fear, and anger are optional keywords inside the `mission_opinion` object. Each keyword must be followed by a numeric value. The NPC's opinion is modified by the value.

---

## Dialogue conditions
Conditions can be a simple string with no other values, a key and an int, a key and a string, a key and an array, or a key and an object. Arrays and objects can nest with each other and can contain any other condition.

The following keys and simple strings are available:

#### Boolean logic

Condition | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
"and" | array | `true` if every condition in the array is true. Can be used to create complex condition tests, like `"[INTELLIGENCE 10+][PERCEPTION 12+] Your jacket is torn. Did you leave that scrap of fabric behind?"`
"or" | array | `true` if every condition in the array is true. Can be used to create complex condition tests, like `"[STRENGTH 9+] or [DEXTERITY 9+] I'm sure I can handle one zombie."`
"not" | object | `true` if the condition in the object or string is false. Can be used to create complex conditions test by negating other conditions, for text such as<br/>`"[INTELLIGENCE 7-] Hitting the reactor with a hammer should shut it off safely, right?"`

#### Player or NPC conditions
These conditions can be tested for the player using the `"u_"` form, and for the NPC using the `"npc_"` form.

Condition | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
"u_male"<br\>"npc_male" | simple string | `true` if the player character or NPC is male.
"u_female"<br\>"npc_female" | simple string | `true` if the player character or NPC is female.
"u_at_om_location"<br\>"npc_at_om_location" | string | `true` if the player character or NPC is standing on an overmap tile with u_at_om_location's id.  The special string "FACTION_CAMP_ANY" changes it to return true of the player or NPC is standing on a faction camp overmap tile.
"u_has_trait"<br\>"npc_has_trait" | string | `true` if the player character or NPC has a specific trait.  Simpler versions of `u_has_any_trait` and `npc_has_any_trait` that only checks for one trait.
"u_has_trait_flag"<br\>"npc_has_trait_flag" | string | `true` if the player character or NPC has any traits with the specific trait flag.  More robust versions of `u_has_any_trait` and `npc_has_any_trait`.  The special trait flag "MUTATION_THRESHOLD" checks to see if the player or NPC has crossed a mutation threshold.
"u_has_any_trait"<br\>"npc_has_any_trait" | array | `true` if the player character or NPC has any trait or mutation in the array. Used to check multiple specific traits.
"u_has_strength"<br\>"npc_has_strength" | int | `true` if the player character's or NPC's strength is at least the value of `u_has_strength` or `npc_has_strength`.
"u_has_dexterity"<br\>"npc_has_dexterity" | int | `true` if the player character's or NPC's dexterity is at least the value of `u_has_dexterity` or `npc_has_dexterity`.
"u_has_intelligence"<br\>"npc_has_intelligence" | int | `true` if the player character's or NPC's intelligence is at least the value of `u_has_intelligence` or `npc_has_intelligence`.
