## Notes

- Many of the flags intended for one category or item type, can be used in other categories or item types. Experiment to see where else flags can be used.
- Offensive and defensive flags can be used on any item type that can be wielded.


## Inheritance

When an item is crafted, it can inherit flags from the components that were used to craft it. This requires that the flag to be inherited has the `"craft_inherit": true` entry. If you don't want a particular item to inherit flags when crafted, you can add the flag `NO_CRAFT_INHERIT` to that item.


## TODO

- Descriptions for `Special attacks` under `Monsters` could stand to be more descriptive of exactly what the attack does.
- `Ammo effects` under `Ammo` need more descriptive details, and some need to be double-checked for accuracy.


## Ammo

### Ammo type

These are handled through `ammo_types.json`.  You can tag a weapon with these to have it chamber existing ammo, or make your own ammo there.  The first column in this list is the tag's "id", the internal identifier DDA uses to track the tag, and the second is a brief description of the ammo tagged.  Use the id to search for ammo listings, as ids are constant throughout DDA's code.  Happy chambering!  :-)
