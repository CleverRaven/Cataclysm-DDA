## Notes

- Some flags (items, effects, vehicle parts) have to be defined in `flags.json` or `vp_flags.json` (with type: `json_flag`) to work correctly.
- Many of the flags intended for one category or item type can be used in other categories or item types.  Experiment to see where else flags can be used.
- Offensive and defensive flags can be used on any item type that can be wielded.


## Inheritance

When an item is crafted, it can inherit flags from the components that were used to craft it.  This requires that the flag to be inherited has the `"craft_inherit": true` entry.  If you don't want a particular item to inherit flags when crafted, specify the member delete_flags, which is an array of strings.  Flags specified there will be removed from the resultant item upon crafting.  This will override flag inheritance, but will not delete flags that are part of the item type itself.


## TODO

- `Ammo type` table is very old and doesn't include many new ammo types.  Consider updating it or removing altogether, as ammo types ain't no json flags at all.


## Ammo

These are handled through [ammo types](../data/json/items/ammo_types.json).  You can tag a weapon with these to have it chamber existing ammo, or make your own ammo there.  The first column in this list is the tag's "id", the internal identifier DDA uses to track the tag, and the second is a brief description of the ammo tagged.  Use the id to search for ammo listings, as ids are constant throughout DDA's code.  Happy chambering!  :-)

### Crafting recipes

These flags apply to crafting recipes, i.e. those that fall within the following categories:

- ```CC_AMMO```
- ```CC_ARMOR```
- ```CC_CHEM```
- ```CC_DRINK```
- ```CC_ELECTRONIC```

### Camp building recipes

These flags apply only to camp building recipes (hubs and expansions), i.e. those that have category `CC_BUILDING`.

- ```NO_FOOD_REQ``` Food requirements are waived for this camp building recipe.


#### Blueprint reorientation flags

The purpose of these flags is to allow reuse of blueprints to create the "same" facility oriented differently.  Mirroring takes place before rotation, and it is an error to try to apply mirroring multiple times with the same orientation, as well as to try to apply multiple rotations.  It is permitted to apply different versions of the flags if they apply to different directions (and it is indeed the primary intended usage).

- ```MAP_MIRROR_HORIZONTAL``` Causes the building recipe to mirror both the location and contents of the blueprint(s) used by the recipe.
- ```MAP_MIRROR_VERTICAL``` Causes the building recipe to mirror both the location and contents of the blueprint(s) used by the recipe.

- ```MAP_MIRROR_HORIZONTAL_IF_[Y]``` Similar to MAP_MIRROR_HORIZONTAL, but is applied only if the tile the expansion is on is Y.  The legal values for Y are "NW", "N", "NE", "E", "SE", "S", SW", and "W".
- ```MAP_MIRROR_VERTICAL_IF_[Y]``` The vertical version of the previous flag.
- ```MAP_ROTATE_[X]_IF_[Y]``` The expansion location dependent version of "MAP_ROTATE_X", with Y having the same legal values as the two sets of flags above.


## Scenarios

- ```BORDERED``` Initial start location is bordered by an enormous wall of solid rock.
