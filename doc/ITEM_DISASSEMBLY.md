# Introduction
This document describes various methods of taking apart items in the game, as well as how these work and how the approach should be balanced. For furniture/terrain ***DECONSTRUCTION*** you're out of luck because we don't have a guide for it.

## The three methods
There are three* general methods of having items taken apart into other items:
- Uncraft recipes
- Reversible crafting recipes
- Salvaging (or Cutting Up)

The first two are able to be altered through JSON, while the other can only be enabled or disabled, with the type and amount of items it gives being calculated by the game from the item's JSON definition.

* - Technically you could argue that butchery is a separate method as well, but given its highly unique nature, and the fact that it's not possible for it to violate the conservation of mass, these are omitted for the purpose of this file.
