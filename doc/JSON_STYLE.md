# JSON Style Guide

Like in `doc/CODE_STYLE.md`, the JSON styling policy is to update JSON as it is added or edited, and in relatively small chunks otherwise in order to prevent undue disruption to development.

We haven't been able to find a decent JSON styling tool, so we wrote our own.  It lives in tools/format/format.cpp and it leverages src/json.cpp to parse and emit JSON.

## JSON Example

This example outlines most of the styling features:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "foo",
    "id": "example",
    "short_array": [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ],
    "short_object": {
      "item_a": "a",
      "item_b": "b"
    },
    "long_array": [
      "a really long string to illustrate line wrapping, ",
      "which occurs if the line is longer than 120 characters"
    ],
    "nested_array": [
      [
        [ "item1", "value1" ],
        [ "item2", "value2" ],
        [ "item3", "value3" ],
        [ "item4", "value4" ],
        [ "item5", "value5" ],
        [ "item6", "value6" ]
      ]
    ]
  }
]
```
Indention is two spaces.
All JSON delimiters except comma and colon are surrounded by whitespace (either a space or a newline).
Comma and colon are followed by whitespace.
Object entries are always newline-separated.
Array entries are newline-separated if the resulting array would exceed 120 characters otherwise (including indention).
Line breaks occur after open brackets, close brackets, or entries.

## Formatting tool

The formatting tool can be found alongside the releases as `json_formatter.exe` or `json_formatter.cgi`, built via `make style-json`, or accessed at <http://dev.narc.ro/cataclysm/format.html>.  It is recommended to add the formatting tool's location to your `PATH` or (if not already present) put it in your Cataclysm-DDA root directory.

Using `make style-json` will format all files included in the JSON validation test, alternatively:
```sh
# Using git to filter JSON files with uncommitted changes (provided there are no spaces in the file or directory names).
git diff --name-only '*.json' | xargs -L 1 json_formmater

# Using git to filter modified JSON files in the current branch.
git diff master --name-only '*.json' | xargs -L 1 json_formmater

# Per-folder formatting.
find path/to/desired/folder -name "*.json" -print0 | xargs -0 -L 1 json_formatter
```
---
If you're using the Visual Studio solution, you can configure Visual Studio with
commands to format all of the JSON in the project.

1. Build the JsonFormatter project by either building the entire solution or
   just that project. This will create a `tools/format/json_formatter.exe`
   binary.
2. Add a new external tool entry ( `Tools` > `External Tools..` > `Add` ) and
   configure it as follows:
   * Title: `Lint All JSON`
   * Command: `C:\windows\system32\windowspowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe`
   * Arguments: `-file $(SolutionDir)\style-json.ps1`
   * Initial Directory: `$(SolutionDir)`
   * Use Output window: *checked*

At this point, you can use the menu ( `Tools` > `Lint All JSON` ) to invoke the
command and can look in the Output Window for the output of running it.
Additionally, you can configure a keybinding for this command by navigating to
`Tools` > `Options` > `Environment` > `Keyboard`, searching for commands
containing `Tools.ExternalCommand` and pick the one that corresponds to the
position of your command in the list (e.g. `Tools.ExternalCommand1` if it's the
top item in the list) and then assign shortcut keys to it.
