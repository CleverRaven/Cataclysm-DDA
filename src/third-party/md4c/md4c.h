 *
 *     ![image alt text](http://example.org/image.png 'foo &quot; bar')
 *
 * The image alt text is propagated as a normal text via the MD_PARSER::text()
 * callback. However, the image title ('foo &quot; bar') is propagated as
 * MD_ATTRIBUTE in MD_SPAN_IMG_DETAIL::title.
 *
 * Then the attribute MD_SPAN_IMG_DETAIL::title shall provide the following:
 *  -- [0]: "foo "   (substr_types[0] == MD_TEXT_NORMAL; substr_offsets[0] == 0)
 *  -- [1]: "&quot;" (substr_types[1] == MD_TEXT_ENTITY; substr_offsets[1] == 4)
 *  -- [2]: " bar"   (substr_types[2] == MD_TEXT_NORMAL; substr_offsets[2] == 10)
 *  -- [3]: (n/a)    (n/a                              ; substr_offsets[3] == 14)
 *
 * Note that these invariants are always guaranteed:
 *  -- substr_offsets[0] == 0
 *  -- substr_offsets[LAST+1] == size
 *  -- Currently, only MD_TEXT_NORMAL, MD_TEXT_ENTITY, MD_TEXT_NULLCHAR
 *     substrings can appear. This could change only of the specification
 *     changes.
