/**
 *  This is DP-based cache/filter that can reject bresenham-based LOS checks in O(1) time.
 *
 *  Each tile stores 4 numbers (single byte each), representing the four quadrants,
 *  each number is the maximal distance it's possible to reach from the "current" tile
 *  into the corresponding quadrant, **using only two cardinal directions.**
 *
 *  I.e. for NW quadrant, two cardinal directions would be N and W,
 *  and "tested" paths could only consist of N and W, i.e. N→N→N is a valid path of distance 3,
 *  W→N→W→N is a valid path of distance 4.  W→N→N→E→N→N is an invalid path and is not considered.
 *  (For the sake of diagonal transparency  N→W is considered a valid path if NW diagonal direction is valid).
 *
 *  It's easy to see that bresenham line starting from the "current tile" could only reach the "target tile",
 *  if  there exists a path (that uses above rules) from "current tile" to the "target tile".
 *  Bresenham line is a special case of such path.
 *
 *  The idea is to test the |dx| + |dy| distance between two points against stored maximal
 *  "path distance" for the quadrant. If the stored maximal distance is less than the actual distance,
 *  we know in advance that the result of bresenham will be negative.
 *
 * @tparam Horizontal  true if cache is horizontal (for points on the same z-level)
 *                      false if cache is for inter-z-lev checks
 * @tparam Params param list needed for cache building
