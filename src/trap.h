 * Some traps are always invisible. They are never revealed as such to the player.
 * They can still be triggered. Use @ref is_always_invisible to check for that.

 * Traps names can be empty. This usually applies to always invisible traps.
 *
 * Some traps are always revealed to the player (e.g. funnels). Other traps can be spotted when
 * the player is close (also needs perception stat).
 *
 * Use @ref map::can_see_trap_at or @ref trap::can_see to check whether a creature knows about a
 * given trap. Monsters / NPCs should base their behavior on that information and not on a simple
 * check for any trap being there (e.g. don't use `map::tr_at(...).is_null()` - that would reveal
