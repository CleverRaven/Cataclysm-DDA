/**
 * A vehicle as a whole with all its components.
 *
 * This object can occupy multiple tiles, the objects actually visible
 * on the map are of type `vehicle_part`.
 *
 * Facts you need to know about implementation:
 * - Vehicles belong to map. There's `std::vector<vehicle>`
 *   for each submap in grid. When requesting a reference
 *   to vehicle, keep in mind it can be invalidated
 *   by functions such as `map::displace_vehicle()`.
 * - To check if there's any vehicle at given map tile,
 *   call `map::veh_at()`, and check vehicle type (`veh_null`
 *   means there's no vehicle there).
 * - Vehicle consists of parts (represented by vector). Parts have some
 *   constant info: see veh_type.h, `vpart_info` structure and
 *   vpart_list array -- that is accessible through `part_info()` method.
 *   The second part is variable info, see `vehicle_part` structure.
 * - Parts are mounted at some point relative to vehicle position (or starting part)
 *   (`0, 0` in mount coordinates). There can be more than one part at
 *   given mount coordinates, and they are mounted in different slots.
 *   Check tileray.h file to see a picture of coordinate axes.
 * - Vehicle can be rotated to arbitrary degree. This means that
 *   mount coordinates are rotated to match vehicle's face direction before
 *   their actual positions are known. For optimization purposes
 *   mount coordinates are precalculated for current vehicle face direction
 *   and stored in `precalc[0]`. `precalc[1]` stores mount coordinates for
 *   next move (vehicle can move and turn). Method `map::displace_vehicle()`
 *   assigns `precalc[1]` to `precalc[0]`. At any time (except
 *   `map::vehmove()` innermost cycle) you can get actual part coordinates
 *   relative to vehicle's position by reading `precalc[0]`.
 *   Vehicles rotate around a (possibly changing) pivot point, and
 *   the precalculated coordinates always put the pivot point at (0,0).
 * - Vehicle keeps track of 3 directions:
 *     Direction | Meaning
 *     --------- | -------
 *     face      | where it's facing currently
 *     move      | where it's moving, it's different from face if it's skidding
 *     turn_dir  | where it will turn at next move, if it won't stop due to collision
 * - Some methods take `part` or `p` parameter. This is the index of a part in
 *   the parts list.
 * - Driver doesn't know what vehicle he drives.
 *   There's only player::in_vehicle flag which
 *   indicates that he is inside vehicle. To figure
 *   out what, you need to ask a map if there's a vehicle
 *   at driver/passenger position.
 * - To keep info consistent, always use
 *   `map::board_vehicle()` and `map::unboard_vehicle()` for
 *   boarding/unboarding player.
 * - To add new predesigned vehicle, add an entry to data/raw/vehicles.json
 *   similar to the existing ones. Keep in mind, that positive x coordinate points
 *   forwards, negative x is back, positive y is to the right, and
 *   negative y to the left:
 *
 *       orthogonal dir left (-Y)
 *            ^
 *       -X ------->  +X (forward)
 *            v
 *       orthogonal dir right (+Y)
 *
 *   When adding parts, function checks possibility to install part at given
 *   coordinates. If it shows debug messages that it can't add parts, when you start
 *   the game, you did something wrong.
 *   There are a few rules:
 *   1. Every mount point (tile) must begin with a part in the 'structure'
 *      location, usually a frame.
 *   2. No part can stack with itself.
 *   3. No part can stack with another part in the same location, unless that
 *      part is so small as to have no particular location (such as headlights).
 *   If you can't understand why installation fails, try to assemble your
 *   vehicle in game first.
