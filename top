    tileset: implement looks_like for items
    
    add a looks_like field to itype, that is filled by the value of copy-from
    if present or looks_like if that is present, preferring the second.
    
    when a tileset loads, if the loader can't find a tile for an item, it will
    see if it has one for the looks_like item. If it doesn't, it will check if
    the looks_like item has a looks_like field, and if it does, try to find a
    tile for that. It will continue the process of looking for looks_like
    tiles until it finds one, or the looks_like field is empty, or it has gone
    through 10 attempts (to avoid looks_like loops). If a looks_like tile is
    found, that will be used; if not, the fallback to ASCII symbol will
    proceed normally.

    default to look-alike tiles: functionalize finding tiles by season
    
    as part of an effort to find a look-alike tile when an object doesn't
    have a tile in a tileset, it's going to be necessary to retrieve
    the seasonal variation of a tile in a lot of different places in the
    code. Move the code to get the seasonal variation into its own function.

    Replace utility lights with overhead lights, revise light probability.
    
    - Overhead lights are dimmer, bashable, and look better in the Chesthole gfxs.
    - Made overhead lights on concrete floor in anticipation of the lab floor PR.
    - Light probability is still half in labs, but now lit sections have a random
      density of lights, making it possible to have entirely lit sections, and
      lights also align with a grid, removing the possibility of adjacent lights.
    - Light density is defined in terms of all possible lights - all, 1 in 3, 1 in
      5... all the way to 1 in 50 (each density has a 1 in 12 chance).
    - Include some updates to the lab_sfx related to the thconc floor change.

    Adjust FRAG effect explosion distance factor
    
    The FRAG effect was creating explosions with a 1.0 distance factor
    which would then trigger an error in the bounds checking of the
    `game::explosion` method (`"called game::explosion with factor >= 1.0 (infinite size)"`).
    
    Based on the comment associated with the FRAG effect
    (`// Same as a standard thrown frag grenade.`)
    the distance factor was adjusted down to 0.8, which is the default value
    used when explosions don't define a distance factor, which the frag
    grenade does not.
    
    Fixes #24630

    game: refactor handle_liquids()
    
    split the logic of handle_liquids() into two functions:
    * get_liquid_target() handles the menu items to get the target of
      the liquid transfer and populated a liquid_dest_opt structure
    * perform_liquid_transfer() handles transfering liquids from the
      source to the target, according to the liquid_dest_opt structure
    
    handle_liquids() is now a wrapper for the new functions.
    
    in the future, this will make it easier to write activity handlers
    that need special cases for handling liquid transfers, because
    they can call get_liquid_target() without commiting to
    perform_liquid_transfer(). I intend to use this functionality in
    a future PR that will turn milking into a player_activity.

    * Created a new abstract template for badges for use with other badges.
    * Utilized copy-from for badges using the new template.
    * Added coverage (torso), thickness, and flags to badges.
    * Made detective badge weight twice, since it's the same size and made from ~2x heavier material (gold).
    * Changed the "shield" and "ID" names to badge to unify and avoid confusion, the descriptions were.
    * Styled the file and fixed double space in judo belt abstract (which I used as a base myself).

    Update vehicleDef.py to produce better vehicle templates
    
    This script previously made the assumption that the order in which parts
    were listed in the save file was valid for a vehicle template, but that
    assumption is easily invalidated if the user is using Hammerspace to
    build the vehicle.
    
    To cut down on the amount of manual work required to get a good vehicle
    template, I updated this script to sort the vehicle frame parts such
    that they are listed in a connected order (e.g. each frame is adjacent
    to another existing frame).
    
    I also updated the script to use OrderedDict to ensure that the json
    keys retained their original order, which keeps the id, type, name, and
    part x, y, and type all in the expected order.

    better milking: rewrite milk_source
    
    rename milk_per_day to milk_freq, since it's a duration, not a count.
    
    remove the redundant check that the milk item is LIQUID - handle_liquid
    will do that.
    
    check the return from handle_liquid, so you don't lose milk if you
    cancel out of the container selection.
    
    increase the size of the milk item to the number of remaining units of
    milk in the creature. Set the duration of the effect_milked equal to the
    count of milk units transferred in handle_liquid.
    
    Net effect is that a survivor can remove all the milk in a creature in
    a single long action, if they have a large enough container.

    better milking: don't use source_mon for fill_liquid_do_turn
    
    it's trivial to return the amount of resources consumed when passing an
    item as the source to fill_liquid_do_turn, and nearly impossible when
    passing a monster. Since monexamine::milk_source is the only code that
    passes a source_mon to handle_liquid and then on to fill_liquid_do_turn,
    simplify life by not passing the source_mon from handle_liquid to
    fill_liquid_do_turn. Instead, fill_liquid_do_turn takes the milk item
    that was already being created my milk_source as the source of the
    transfer liquid activity.

    Added chair and bench as possible sleeping spots
    
    Bench already have the ironical "hobo bed" in description (which was what prompted me to look at the code in the first place) and armchair is quite a nice sleeping spot, so I assume your character is fine with sitting while sleeping (also vehicle seats and sofas assuming you sit there, not lie).
    Also, both chairs and benches were already being used for warming up along with the armchair that you also can sleep at.
    
    I made the bonuses quite minuscule though, making it only better at warming (since you aren't lying on the ground) and no better at getting to sleep than wood floor or carpet (but better than random tile still, including other floor types). I also decided not to add them to the list of "This is a comfortable place to sleep.", because well… it is not a comfortable place to sleep :).
    
    It was also tempting to add more furniture for warming (sofa, bed, straw bed, makeshift bed, hay – basically the furniture not the traps except tatami) to the list of things you can sit on to warm up near the fire, but I decided it's better to keep it for maybe a separate PR later on, especially as it's more niche functionality.
    
    Could be interesting for new survivors to decide where to sleep and not bash all the benches mindlessly, too, especially for insomniacs.

    Makes the prime mutations give a bonus to gradual bonus to stats < 15.
    
    Instead of a flat bonus, prime mutations will now continue to give the +1/+2
    of their precursor mutation, plus increase any base stat < 15 to be halfway
    towards 16 (rounding down).
    
    This replaces the behavior for high stats where mutating to alpha could be a
    penalty, because it didn't provide the +1/+2 of the mutation it replaced.
    
    This is a significant boost to really low stats, a wash for mid-stats, and for
    high stats depends very much on player behavior:
    - If players didn't know mutating past the threshold would screw them, this
      is a bonus, in that nothing changes when they mutate.
    - If a player was mutating up to the threshold and stopping, this has no effect
      they can mutate over the threshold or not and stats will be the same.

    * add build-scripts/Dockerfile.debian-build, a Dockerfile based on Debian for building CDDA (based on debian testing to get clang-6.0) (#24147)
    
    * add apt-fast for parallelized package downloads for faster builds to Dockerfile.debian-build
    * add tons of build libraries and convenience utilties to Dockerfile.debian-build. Note that the container is quite heavy. This is an atomic SUV of a container. For automated builds and such we probably want a smaller build container, and also a "multi-stage build" in Docker parlance, where the build container and the result image are two different images. Also we probably stand to benefit from cleaning apt install cache and doing a --squash build. (I personally don't think monolithic RUN steps in Dockerfiles are necessary with the advent of easy --squash'ing and multi-stage builds, and big monolithic RUNs are fragile and are harder to cache so there's reason to avoid them.)
    * add debugger and notes on debugger to Dockerfile.debian-build
    * remove gcc/g++ from  Dockerfile.debian-build
    * add commented-out CMD/EXPOSE stuff for sshd server to Dockerfile.debian-build, to have an easy option of starting sshd for testing play over ssh in the container
    * configure both tiles and curses builds with cmake in Dockerfile.debian-build, but don't actually run the builds (for now)
    * have Dockerfile.debian-build detect number of CPUs. The build seems to use up to 2.5GB of RAM with up to 16 processes on an 8-core machine. (Data point: An unlimited-thread build with `make -j` will hang the same machine).

    installing the CBM on the NPC.

    Add special effects to 1 in 10 lab sections.
    
    - Areas fully flooded with shallow water or sewage.
    - Areas minorly flooded with shallow water or sewage.
    - Areas with ~2 vents that release toxic gas or smoke.
    - Areas with anomalies with a portal in the center.
    
    There are also some various tweaks:
    - fd_gas_vent now uses density, so there can be a low density gas vent in labs
      but a high density gas vent in mines.  Gas away from vents dissolves faster.
    - new fd_smoke_vent based on the gas vent.
    - The smoke vent in the lab has a higher density to compensate for smoke
      dissolving faster than gas. In practice, they fill about the same area.
    - Shadow & shadow snakes last longer, and tr_snake resets the cooldown on
      disappearing so that snakes will last a random duration (already true for
      tr_shadow).
    - The anomalies don't place rubble normally, so that special logic can avoid
      destroying stairs or consoles that might be critical to the lab.  Also
      limited the list of effects to things that tangibly affect the player. Unlike
      place_anomaly, there's no artifact at the center, instead a portal.  Note:
      portals still don't do anything but look pretty.

    Fix foraging behavior
    Some plants after harvesting were being dropped in different positions. This PR standardizes every foraging instance to drop the harvest on the player's feet. Harvesting from a tree, for example, requires the item to be dropped on a tile other than the tree itself, so standardizing on the player's feet works.

    limit scrolling such that you can't scroll if all the descriptions

    vehicle part descriptions: handle overflow and scrolling
    
    change vpart_info::format_description to count the number of lines
    printed and return that value.
    
    change vehicle:print_vparts_desc to count the number of lines it is
    printing versus the window size, and to add scroll messages if the
    there are more lines of description than available space. Add an offset,
    so the descriptions don't always start printing at the frame part.
    
    adjust veh_interact::do_main_loop to add the keybinds for scrolling
    through the descriptions.
    
    incidentally, in veh_interact::move_cursor, correctly pass the size of
    w_msg so descriptions get line wrapped to the width of the window and not
    the height.

    Now that vehicle part descriptions take up space in the w_msg window,

    vehicle part descriptions: make a format_description function
    
    vehicle part descriptions might be useful in places other than the
    install menu, so move the code that formats the description into its
    own function.

    vehicle descriptions: expanded descriptions
    
    Feedback from reddit and discourse is that the vehicle descriptions are useful,
    but could use some more details on interactions. Add the default keystrokes to
    use controls, the interactions between seats and seatbelts, and the commands
    to use most of the crafting rigs and engineering tools to the descriptions.

    Improve place_nested: Allow more generous neighbor matching and an else option.
    
    - "chunks" are placed if neighbors match, and "else_chunks" otherwise.
    - Neighbor now matches a substring ("lab" matches "ice_lab" & "lab_stairs")
    
    This was used to fix-up lab json to better handle non-lab segments.
    - We used to try to match on empty_rock to decide to place border walls.
    - Now we match on "lab", and put border walls in the else place.
    - As a result, we correctly handle being next to subways, ant hives, etc.
    - The newly created is_ot_subtype was also used to improve the lab mapgen.cpp.

    Automatically balance hardcoded & json lab & lab finales against each other.
    
    - The 3 lab sections have a 500 weight each (cross, tic-tac-toe, big room)
    - The 4 lab finales have a weight of 100 each, except arms testing is 200.
    - An example lab finale map was added as an example, a buffed up autodoc room.
      - Modified with a change of bionics and 4-9 anesthetic, plus a shocker brute.
      - Weight is only 25, since I think it's less cool than the other finales.
    - Finales will now properly handle stairs.
    - Json finales should be called lab_finale_1level.  Hope is to sometime add 2level finales.

    Crossbow adjustment
    
    Adds a firing noise and slightly adjusts damage/range to comply with the bolt changes in the Arrow/Bolt PR. Also reduces reload time somewhat since my research suggested reload time for a crossbow is closer to 30 seconds (or whatever 500 reload time works out to).

    Bow Adjustments
    
    Bows are divided into small and large. Large bows have higher damage and range, while small bows are much faster to fire. Existing bows have been divided between the two categories and set out in a linear progression. The compound bow is somewhat of an outlier since it's still quite small, but it's slower and more powerful than the top large bow, but that's just due to realism.
    
    Some firing/reloading noise was added for realism, though it won't have much impact, especially with later changes. Bows were made belted, since it was silly that they were worn on the normal layer. Removed the primitive ranged weapon tag from the compound bow, since it isn't. That will probably let players accurize it with a gun kit, but I consider that a feature.

    vehicle: allow tracking and electronics control from top level menu
    
    make toggling tracking an option you can take from any vehicle tile, even
    for vehicles that don't have controls or have controls you can't access
    
    remove a redundant check to interact_vehicle_locked from
    interact_with_vehicle, because use_controls makes the same call.

    tomato realism iron nerf
    
    my sources told me that tomatoes were iron rich, however your average tomato contains very little per 100g as the species is mostly there for shelf life rather than nutritional value, but they do help you absorb more iron.

    More research, phytic acid nerf
    
    nuts and beans both have phytic acid, wheat does have some iron but has a lot of phytic acid, and therefore has very low iron values.

    More Complete and Rebalanced Vitamins
    
    No more unrealistic vegetarian anemia!
    Nuts, Tomatoes and beans all are a great source of iron!
    Flesh had unrealistically high iron values previously so that's a bit too.
    
    Milk and insect flesh also has some now as per real life.
    
    Added materials to appropriate foods and tested ingame for balance, let me know if I missed anything.
    
    Balanced vs Flesh material based on real life statistics.
    
    Game should now be very playable with simplified nutrition off for all players!

    Reload will ignore bows in vicinity
    Fixes #24272. Now pressing 'r' to reload will ignore bows in inventory
    and vicinity. The old message will only appear if you manually select to
    reload a bow in the inventory screen. Also explained the function
    game::reload, regarding the reload menu appearance.

    vehicles: add submenu for controlling multiple electronics
    
    add an option to spawn a submenu that allows changing the state of
    multiple pieces of electronics without having to reinvoke the vehicle
    control menu.
    
    individual devices can still be controlled from the main vehicle control
    menu.

    chickenfeed: make chickens and other small domestic birds tameable
    
    Extends the pet food system to cover chickens, turkeys, and crows.
    Adds craftable chickenfeed, made from seeds, grains, or bread, and makes
    it an uncommon drop in vet offices and pet stores.
    
    Slightly refactors the petfood call, because the various specific
    food cases were getting out of hand and were basically identical
    code.
    
    Fixes #24216

    Gluten free and Lactose free recipes
    
    Take this presentation as a discussion for the benefits of such a mod. I will use this in my own game for RP characters with intolerances, so long term they can get some enjoyment out of cooking (in a similar way some of the other debuffs can be negated late game).
    This is not an exhaustive list just yet.
    
    I have assumed all non-wheat flour is "cornmeal" until I get around to renaming and making new categories (rice flour, almond/nut flour, acorn flour etc).
    
    I have matched ingredient types of cornmeal to be "veggy" the same as the current build does.
    
    I am assuming all coconut milk in game is industrially made and fortified (as not player craftable currently), so no nutrition changes yet (IRL AFAIK it is often sweetened, but naturally less cholesterol, so health stat wise is about the same?). I plan to double check nutrition if and when I make player crafted rice/nut milk.
    
    I have not modified batter yet. This will also need to be considered. But currently is not labeled "wheat" in the main build.
    
    Cake. You can now craft a gluten free Johnny cake. Because we all deserve cake. Even those gluten free and lactose free dice roll player characters crave for it!
    
    All of this is obsolete if and when the game engine tracks ingredients natively. But for now I want to add it to my game for role play/artistic reasons. So am offering it up to the community too.

    Update Bionics descriptions with surgery reference
    
    A small proposal to add a few changes of "installation" or "implanted" references to also reference surgery. Not all description changed, just those that already clearly reference the installation process in the descriptions.

    Document revisions for ISSUES.md
    
    Made a few changes to improve the readability of ISSUES.md. Not a critique of anyone's writing ability, but I noticed a few areas that could cause confusions for readers.
       - Removed a few cases where unneeded words were used, leading to overly "wordy" sentences
       - Rephrased the sentence about creating GitHub issues from forum discussions, making the meaning clearer
       - Other revisions to improve readability and concision

    Time to use FRAGILE_MELEE: round two, SPEAR_FORKED (#24014)
    
    The past change in the knifespear caused a violent reaction, and therefore, changing all the weapons IMMEDIATELY, would inevitably cause an even more negative reaction. So I'll slowly move the Overton window in that direction until we can fix all of the "earlygame spearkite problem" weapons with FRAGILE_MELEE.
    It's time to fix REALLY "big sacred cow" of initially spears - wooden pole with three tied spikes. Compare to knife spear, this ultimate weapon even more usable, and can be better than most of initially 1-hex weapons beacuse of fine damage and block2. Current situation completely ruin not only battles; starting options with points and recipes is completely useless, such as tonfu.

    Add a user query for problematic max weight.
    
    This query only triggers if the carried weight would become 4 times higher than safe carrying weight.
    
    If the player accepts, the character will proceed into wielding the item and then fall over under the weight.
    
    This is just another way to access the current 'w'ield process for the same situation.

    Added multi_cooker to surface_heat and water_boiling_heat, as currently it can not be used in any recipe, making it a glorified food warmer. This does *not fix* being unable to use it for food processor actions, like making flour, despite the mutlicooker incorporating a food processor.

    * rename input_context.display_help() to input_context.display_menu() for clarity (imo ~ _menu both presents stuff and allows selection while _help doesn't indicate configurability ~ imo)
    * have keybindings menu take all avalable height until hotkeys are exhausted, and remain centered vertically
    * move input_context generation to top of 'display_help()' function to be able to get available hotkey count for keybinding menu height calculation
    * cap keybinding menu at 80 characters wide
    * introduce constants for LEGEND_HEIGHT and BORDER_SPACE in keybindings menu calculations
    * grab `using std::min/max` shorthand so we can call min()/max() instead of std::min()/max()

    Fixes #23883 creatures teleporting up z-levels
    
    Creatures may no longer climb z-levels without stairs or ladders
    unless they have the climb or fly flags set.
    This prevents zombies running up walls and in through windows to
    ruin a player's day.
    Climbing creatures may strand themselves on z-levels that they can
    climb to but which do not have stairs/ladders. This is likely less
    detrimental than previous behavior but may need to be revisited.

    Change map::accessible_items to not check the path to the target
    
    Do this outside of the function call, as it (usually) applies to more code:
    
    One must skip vehicles and furniture at inaccessible locations as well.

    Only prevent access to map items via map::accessible_items
    
    When the function returns `false`, don't use the items directly on the map.
    
    Items in vehicles can be used (for now).
    
    This is consistent with code in "crafting.cpp" and "inventory_ui.cpp", which use the map function that way. They do not prevent access to the vehicle that way.

    Prevent burning products to be of the same time as the burned item.

    Fix spawning burn products.
    
    What previously happened (for items counted by charges, like copper wire):
    
    `item::burn` would remove charges when it considered the item to get burned. This basically means some of the items that make up the single `item` instance are destroyed.
    If this left charges in the item, it would return `false` (= item was not completely destroyed). Therefor nothing happened in the field processing code.
    
    But if there were no charges left (and this included the case that `item::charges` got negative because more charges were "consumed" than there were in the first place), than it returns `true`.
    
    Now `create_burnproducts` calls `item::weight` to get the weight of the destroyed item, which returns a negative value (simple calculation: weight of one charge (`itype::weight`) times `item::charge`, which is negative).
    
    It proceeds to calculate the weight per material: `weight / all_mats.size()`. The second operand is unsigned, making the whole calculation unsigned, which would not be a problem if only positive values were involved, but as it happens `weight` is negative. So it's converted to an unsigned value (and becomes a large number), divided by a small number (material count) and later divided by the weight of a single burn product item (which is usually a small number as well).
    
    The result is a *very* large number of items to spawn as burn product.
    
    This commit fixes it by properly detecting consumed weight.

    Move vehicle::obstacle_at_part into vpart_position
    
    Change the return value to be `cata::optional<vpart_reference>`. This fixes some places where the result of the vehicle function was used in a boolean context (it's a part index, an integer, not a boolean).
    
    Also adds a wrapper in `optional_vpart_position` so one does not have to check that first.

    Add a wrapper optional_vpart_position::part_with_feature
    
    So one does not have to check the `vpart_position` first.
    
    It returns the usual value of -1 if the optional does not contain a `vpart_position`. This is the same as if there was no part with that feature found.

    Move desctructors into cpp file:
    
    So one can use the classes without needing the destructors of the members to be visible.
    
    (In this case, "melee.cpp" tried to deconstruct objects of those types, which triggered deconstruction of `std::list<item_category>` and of `pimpl<item_category>`, which required `item_category` to be a complete type.)

    Make bone inedible.
    
    #23734 brought it to my attention that bone is listed as edible, this corrects that.
    
    Some bones are edible, but a large proportion of them are not, unless they're differentiated, none should be edible.

    Separated subway and sewer groups
    
    Subway cannot be in same overmap_location as sewer due to overmap_connection::pick_subtype_for always defaulting to the first overmap_connection that is in the same type overmap_location to connect two points.  I'm not sure if this is intentional.  I figured roads might utilize the defaulting on z0, with makes sense.  Subways should be on z-2 vs z-1 anyways.

    Somehow the commits in #23721 managed to get it converted to CRLF (maybe

    * Support for byproducts from burnt items
    * Changed wood ash to non-flammable material
    Existing scrap items where available.  Metals aren't flammable, but destroyed items that are partially metal would have their metal parts voided from existance otherwise.
    * Increased granularity of ash
    Otherwise a anything smaller than a two by four won't yield any ash whatsoever.

    Enlarged 5x50 ammunition
    Assuming 5x50 is the casing measurement+caliber, the 5x50 should be closer to the .223 than the .22 LR. Shrunk it to 50 to allow it to fit inside current magazines without enlarging them as well.

    Move getting and setting vehicle labels into vpart_position:
    
    Change the getter to return an `optional<string>` object to easily indicate the presence or absence of the label.
    
    Adds function `optional::value_or` (compatible with standard library version of that class).

    Implement a wrapper for the result of map::veh_at
    
    The wrapper is practically a `optional<std::pair<vehicle&, int>>`, so it's essentially the same as before.
    The overload with the out-parameter has been removed as it's not needed, the actual result type contains it now.
    
    A new class has been created instead of using `std::pair<vehicle&, int>` as that allows adding more functions to it.

    Rebalanced cotton weights (#23639)
    
    * Rebalanced cotton weights
    
    - Cotton balls: 22g, average 100ct bag of cotton balls weights ~45g, exists ingame as two portions per bag
    12% of original weight
    
    - Cotton bolls: 26g, 1 boll = 1 ball, extra 4g to account for chaff
    5% of original weight
    
    - Thread: Recipe requires 3 balls rather than 2 to better match weight.  ~24% material loss
    
    * Made pillows conserve mass
    
    Disassembling pillows no longer destroys cotton balls, but honestly, the notion that somehow you lose half the stuffing disassembling it is silly.
    
    * Lowered rags to 80 thread

    Revert exception throw in rewrite_vsnprintf()
    
    This is documented as the intended behaviour of the method, it's a limited workaround on a niche and broken platform (Cygwin), and making it throw an exception here prevents it from functioning correctly in a lot of circumstances.
    
    A more complete fix for these edge cases is outside the scope of this PR.

    The test suite handles exceptions on its own.
    
    The `string_formatter` code that calls `raw_string_format` already throws upon other errors, so they caller (the `string_format` wrapper function) already handles it.

    Remove double translation: the input to ngettext must not be translated.
    
    The extraction script extracts the input to `ngettext` on its own, it does not need to be marked for extraction.
    It makes no sense to translate it up front, because `ngettext` does the translation using the correct plural, but `_` does not know about plural, nor does it know (at runtime) the actual number to consider.

    Add gcc attribute "format_arg" to some functions in translations.h
    
    The attribute signals that the input parameter is "translated" (whatever that means) and the returned string contains the *same* printf-like format specifiers as the input.
    This means gcc can deduct that `printf(_("Some number: %d"), 1.0)` is forwarding a string containing a "%d" format specifier to `printf`, even through it's not called directly.
    
    Note that gcc does not allow attributes on function definitions, only on declarations, therefor the separate declaration of `_`.

    Remove code that has no effect:
    
    `current_age` and `current_density` are of type `int`, so is the result of the division (which is done *before* the addition of `0.5`).
    The `0.5` is added to an `int` and the result is immediately converted to an `int`. The `0.5` is simply removed again and adding it was completely pointless.
