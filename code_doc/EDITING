ADDITIONS

1.1 Adding an item
 1) Edit itype.h.  Change the enum item_id and insert a unique identifier for
    your new item type. Be sure to put it among similar items.
 2) Edit itypedef.cpp.  Macros are used for all item types, and they are pretty
    self-explanatory.  Be ABSOLUTELY sure that you insert the macro at the same
    point in the list as you inserted the identifier in item_id!
 3) Your item type is now valid, but won't be spawned.  If you want it to be
    spawned among similar items,  edit mapitemsdef.cpp.  Find the appropriate
    array(s), and insert the identifier for your item (e.g. itm_aspirin).  Make
    sure it comes in before the NULL at the end of the list.
 5) Some items, like tools or food, also take an iuse::function reference.
    Edit iuse.h and include the function in the class declaration; then edit
    iuse.cpp and define your function.  Functions may be shared among different
    item types.

1.2 Adding a monster
 1) Edit mtype.h.  Change the enum mon_id and insert a unique identifier for
    your new monster type.  Be sure to put it among similar monsters.
 2) Edit mtypedef.cpp.  A macro is used for monsters and it is pretty
    straightforward (Any of this ring a bell?).  Be ABSOLUTELY sure that you
    insert the macro at the same point in the list as your inserted the
    identifier in mon_id!
 3) Your monster type is now valid, but won't be spawned.  If you want it to be
    spawned among similar monsters, edit mongroupdef.cpp.  Find the appropriate
    array, and insert the identifier for your monster (e.g, mon_zombie).  Make
    sure it comes in before the NULL at the end of the list.
 4) If you want your monster to drop items, edit monitemsdef.cpp.  Make a new
    array for your monster type with all the map item groups it may carry, and a
    chance value for each.
 5) Your monster may have a special attack, a monattack::function reference.
    Edit monattack.h and include the function in the class definition; then
    edit monattack.cpp and define your function.  Functions may be shared among
    different monster types.  Be aware that the function should contain a
    statement that the monster uses to decide whether or not to use the attack,
    and if they do, should reset the monster's attack timer.
 7) Just like attacks, some monsters may have a special function called when
    they die.  This works the same as attacks, but the relevent files are
    mondeath.h and mondeath.cpp.

1.3 Adding a recipe
 1) Edit recipes.json. Add your recipe among similar recipes. Required fields
    are "result", "category", "difficulty", "time", "autolearn", "components".
    Optional fields are "reversible" (defaults to false), "tools" (defaults to
    none), "skill_pri" (primary skill, defaults to none), "skill_sec" (defaults
    to none), "id_suffix" (disambiguates recipes with the same result, must be
    unique among the set of such recipes), "decomp_learn" (the level (if any)
    when you can learn it from disassembly), "book_learn" (a list of books that
    teach the recipe, and the level they teach it at).
    
1.4 Adding/editing armour and how armour protection is calculated
 1) Edit armor.json and add your armor item near similar types.
 2) The fields are:
        "type" : "ARMOR", // this must be ARMOR
        "id" : "socks",     // the identifier used by the game.  Must be one continuous word, use underscores if necessary
        "name" : "socks",   // the name appearing in the examine box.  Can be more than one word separated by spaces
        "weight" : 1,       // weight of armour
        "color" : "blue",   // ascii character colour
        "covers" : ["FEET"],    // where it covers.  Possible options are TORSO, HEAD, EYES, MOUTH, ARMS, HANDS, LEGS, FEET
        "to_hit" : 0,       // to-hit bonus if using it as a melee weapon (whatever for?)
        "storage" : 0,      // how many volume storage slots it adds
        "symbol" : "[",     // ascii character
        "description" : "Socks. Put 'em on your feet.", // description of armour
        "price" : 100,      // price of armour, used when bartering with NPCs
        "material" : ["COTTON", "NULL"],    // material types.  See materials.json for possible options
        "volume" : 1,       // volume occupied
        "cutting" : 0,      // cutting damage caused by using it as a melee weapon
        "warmth" : 10,      // how much warmth clothing provides
        "phase" : "solid",  // what phase it is
        "enviromental_protection" : 0,  // how much environmental protection it affords
        "rarity" : 70,      // determines how often it spawns
        "encumberance" : 0, // base encumbrance (unfitted value)
        "bashing" : -5,     // bashing damage caused by using it as a melee weapon
        "flags" : ["VARSIZE"]   // used to indicate clothing type which can be fitted.  Leave out the flags field entirely if clothing cannot be fitted
        "coverage" : 80,    // what percentage of body part
        "material_thickness" : 1    // thickness of material, in millimetre units (approximately).  Generally ranges between 1 - 5, more unusual armour types go up to 10 or more
 3) When the player is hit at a specific body part, armour coverage determines whether the armour is hit, or an uncovered part of the player is hit (roll 1d100 against coverage)
 4) If the above roll fails (ie roll value is above coverage), then the armour does not absorb any damage from the blow, neither does it become damaged
 5) If the above roll succeeds, the armour is hit, possibly absorbing some damage and possibly getting damaged in the process
 6) The above steps are repeated for each layer of armour on the body part
 7) Armour protects against bash and cut damage.  These are determined by multiplying the armour thickness by the material bash/cut resistance factor respectively, given in materials.json
 8) If the armour is made from 2 materials types, then it takes a weighted average of the primary material (66%) and secondary material (33%).
 9) Materials resistance factors are given relative to PAPER as a material (this probably needs some fine-tuning for balance).
 
1.5 Adding a bionic
 1) Edit data/raw/bionics.json and add your bionic near similar types.

 2) Add the required attributes

    id          :   "bio_rocketlauncher"                        // Text string used as identifier in the code.
    name        :   "CBM: Rocket Launcher"                      // The bionic's name, as showed to the player.
    cost        :   10                                          // How many PUs it costs to use the bionic.
    time        :   0                                           // How long, when activated, between drawing cost. If 0, it draws power once.
    description :   "It's a rocket launcher, inside your arm!!" // A brief description of the bionic, as showed to the player.

 3) Add any otional attributes
    
    flags       :   ["ACTIVE"]                                  // Used to flag the bionic as a specific type.
    
                    Supported flags:

                        "ACTIVE"    :   The bionic can be manually activated and deactivated.
                        "POWER"     :   The bionic provides a source of power.
                        "FAULTY"    :   The bionic is an unwanted one, will typically have negative effects.
                        
                    Flags can be combined like so: ["ACTIVE","POWER","FAULTY"] (Don't add all these at once)
    
 4) If you want the bionic to be available in the gameworld as an item, add it to itypedef.cpp
    
    BIO_SINGLE(id, rarity, price, color, difficulty)
