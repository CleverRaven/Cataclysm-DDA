## Guidelines

There are a couple of guidelines we suggest sticking to:

* Add the repository as an `upstream` remote.
* Keep your `master` branch clean. This means you can easily pull changes made to this repository into yours.
* Create a new branch for each new feature or set of related bug fixes.
* Never merge from your local branches into your `master` branch. Only update `master` by pulling from `upstream/master`.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Why does `git pull --ff-only` result in an error?

If `git pull --ff-only` shows an error, it means that you've committed directly to your local `master` branch. To fix this, you can create a new branch with these commits, find the point at which you diverged from `upstream/master`, and then reset `master` to that point.

    $ git pull --ff-only upstream master
    From https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA
     * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
    fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting.
    $ git branch new_branch master          # mark the current commit with a tmp branch
    $ git merge-base master upstream/master
    cc31d0... # the last commit before we committed directly to master
    $ git reset --hard cc31d0....
    HEAD is now at cc31d0... ...

Now that `master` has been cleaned up, you can easily pull from `upstream/master`, and then continue working on `new_branch`.

    $ git pull --ff-only upstream master
    # gets changes from the "upstream" remote for the matching branch, in this case "master"
    $ git checkout new_branch
