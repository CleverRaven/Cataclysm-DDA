# This is the keymapping for Cataclysm.
# You can start a line with # to make it a comment--it will be ignored.
# Blank lines are ignored too.
# Extra whitespace, including tab, is ignored, so format things how you like.

# The format for each line is an action identifier, followed by several
# keys.  Any action may have an unlimited number of keys bound to it.
# If you bind the same key to multiple actions, the second and subsequent
# bindings will be ignored--and you'll get a warning when the game starts.
# Keys are case-sensitive, of course; c and C are different.
 
# WARNING: If you skip an action identifier, there will be no key bound to
# that action!  You will be NOT be warned of this when the game starts.
# If you're going to mess with stuff, maybe you should back this file up?

# It is okay to split commands across lines.
# pause . 5      is equivalent to:
# pause .
# pause 5

# Note that movement keybindings ONLY apply to movement (for now).
# That is, binding w to move_n will let you use w to move north, but you
# cannot use w to smash north, examine to the north, etc.
# For now, you must use vikeys, the numpad, or arrow keys for those actions.
# This is planned to change in the future.

# Finally, there is no support for special keys, like spacebar, Home, and
# so on.  This is not a planned feature, but if it's important to you, please
# let me know.
