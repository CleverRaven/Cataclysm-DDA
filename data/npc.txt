# This file currently has two options, disabling starting npcs and 
# disabling randomly spawning npcs spawned by the dynamic spawn system
 
# Turning on the starting_npc setting only has effect on new character
# creation. None of these settings get rid of already spawned npcs. Use
# the debug menu for that.
	
# WARNING: NPC's are currently broken. When used expect bugs and crashes.
# You have been warned.
# None of these settings prevent you from spawning npcs using the debug menu.
