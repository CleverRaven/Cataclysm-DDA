  <summary>
    A turn-based survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world
  </summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistent, procedurally
      generated world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization
      for food, equipment, or, if you are lucky, a vehicle with a full
      tank of gas to get you the hell out of Dodge. Fight to defeat or
      escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities, from
      zombies to giant insects to killer robots and things far
      stranger and deadlier, and against the others like yourself,
      that want what you have...
    </p>
    <p>
      As your game begins, you awaken with hazy memories of violence
      and terror from when the world suddenly unraveled around
      you. Now you need to explore your surroundings, and secure food,
      water and safety. After that, who knows? Long term survival will
      mean tapping abilities you haven’t used before, learning to
      survive in this new environment and developing new skills.
    </p>

    <release version="0.F Frank" date="2021-07-02">
      <description>
        <p>
          After a long and anticlimactic buildup, we are pleased to
          announce the release of stable version 0.F "Frank" of
          Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead! Like our previous stable
          versions, this release features an expansive range of
          bugfixes, code and content additions, and new features.
          4,500 new game entities were added, 123,162 lines of source
          code were inserted, and 77,727 lines were deleted.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal was to have a smaller and more manageable release
          this cycle, which was an utter failure, as it took well over
          a year and by several measures was even larger than the 0.E
          cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'd overall characterize 0.F as a release with a lot of
          content and polish. Compared to 0.E, you may find it a
          little more difficult (the pendulum swings ever back and
          forth), but we think also more rewarding.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most obvious feature of 0.F is the addition of nested
          inventory, the ability to store items in containers and
          have them behave as you'd expect. This is probably the most
          long awaited and highly requested feature of the past five
          years of development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides pockets, 0.F features the addition of achievements
          for fun and bragging rights, a proficiency system to
          represent more refined skill knowledge, blood loss mechanics
          for you and your enemies, weariness that builds as you push
          yourself to your limits, vehicles that can drive up and down
          z-levels (and bridges that are above rivers, enabling more
          navigable rivers, as a result), and a vast host of new
          content from new monsters and evolutions to new quests and items.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the mod side, Magiclysm, Aftershock, and Dinomod have all
          grown expansively, including new artifact and enchantment
          systems that have impacted content in the main game.
          And much more, too much to list here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Players coming from the last stable will notice a switch
          towards encouraging looting over crafting, especially in
          the early game, and will have to be cautious about
          overextending themselves in the beginning of their survival
          effort. As usual, you'll want to avoid getting into combat
          with multiple zombies in an open area. However, you can also
          have 'grab bags' of useful gear and tools, allowing you to
          toss your loot sack to the floor to engage in an
          unencumbered melee battle with zombies!
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all, as usual, we're deeply excited about this new
          version, and look forward to continuing to make your
          survival difficult in the months to come.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Nested Containers rationalize inventory management and enable dropping and retrieving go-bags during fights.</li>
          <li>Achievements track your deeds and misdeeds across games.</li>
          <li>Proficiencies better represent deeper knowledge required for various endeavors, mostly crafting.</li>
          <li>Bleeding added to both the player and monsters as the first step toward a more comprehensive wound and wound treatment system.</li>
          <li>Weariness tracking added to represent longer-term physical exhaustion.</li>
          <li>Elevated bridges over navigable rivers added, allowing better navigability while using boats.</li>
          <li>Large-scale audit of weapon and armor values for better representativeness and consistency.</li>
          <li>Improved armor handling by separating ballistic damage into its own damage type.</li>
          <li>Pervasive performance enhancements throughout the game.</li>
          <li>Tileset vehicle support for more cohesive vehicle rendering.</li>
          <li>Aftershock changes direction to a total conversion mod with a new far-future setting on a frozen world.</li>
          <li>Dinomod added 238 dinosaurs, pterosaurs, mosasaurs, and dino-related NPCs with missions and dino locations.</li>
          <li>Added many dino features, including zombie, fungal, evolved, bionic, baby, and mutant dino variants.</li>
          <li>Dinomod added many dino interactions, including farming, riding, butchering, cooking, and special attacks.</li>
          <li>Magiclysm added a huge content update including many new traits called Attunements that switch up gameplay at the endgame.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

          not comprehensive) listing of new features and contents -

    </release>
    <release version="0.E Ellison" date="2020-04-01">
      <description>
        <p>
          The Ellison release adds a huge number of features and content
          that make the world feel more alive. From being able to climb
          onto building rooftops or hide behind cars, to building a camp
          for your followers in the wilderness, to exploring the new
          river and lake systems on a boat or raft, everything is more
          immersive and consistent. Also more STUFF. I didn’t think we
          would ever double the number of game entities with a release
          again, but we did.
        </p>
        <p>
          We aimed at a 6 month release cycle, and ended up spending 9
          months adding features at a breakneck pace and 3 months
          putting the brakes on and stabilizing. I can’t honestly say
          that’s a huge disappointment, though toward the end the rest
          of the development team was really chomping at the bit to get
          back to feature work, so we’ll need to continue to adjust.
        </p>
        <p>
          We built a huge amount of infrastructure for having the game
          check its own consistency, which has and is going to continue
          to contribute to the amazing pace of feature and content
          additions we are experiencing. The development team is also
          larger and at the same time more cohesive than it has ever
          been before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Explore all the new features with the attached release
          archives. Speaking of exploring, the list of available
          tilesets has shuffled a bit, so this is a great time to find
          your new favorite.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Long distance automove feature for walking, driving and boating.</li>
          <li>Extensive bugfixes to inter-level interactivity, on by default.</li>
          <li>Riding animals and animal-pulled vehicles.</li>
          <li>More flexible Basecamp construction options.</li>
          <li>Default starting date changed to mid-spring for better survivability.</li>
          <li>Time advancement is rationalized, a turn is now one second.</li>
          <li>Extensive river and lake systems, and boat support for navigating them.</li>
          <li>Expanded NPC usefulness and interactivity.</li>
          <li>Massive increases in location variety and consistency, especially rooftops.</li>
          <li>Expansion of mi-go faction with new enemies and locations.</li>
          <li>Batteries now store charge instead of being pseudo-items.</li>
          <li>Overhaul and rebalance of martial arts.</li>
          <li>Zombie grabbing and biting more manageable and predictable.</li>
          <li>Overhauled stamina and damage recovery for grittier gameplay.</li>
          <li>Crouching movement mode allows hiding.</li>
          <li>Magiclysm and Aftershock mods have first class support within the game.</li>

    <release version="0.D Danny" date="2019-03-08">
      <description>
        <p>
          The Danny release is characterized by MORE. More UI polish,
          more features, more content, more long-asked-for
          changes. It’s the longest-lived and largest in every way
          release we’ve ever done, and we hope to never do it
          again. Future releases are planned for roughly 6-month
          intervals. This release is made up of 37,604 commits
          authored by over 700 contributors, and it roughly doubled
          the number of everything in the game, items, monsters, map
          buildings, you name it, we doubled it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s honestly way too huge to summarize in any meaningful
          way, but here are the absolute biggest changes, and you’ll
          just have to dig into the changelog or the game itself for
          more detail.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Many quality of life enhancements such as auto-pulp,
            autopickup, batch actions, interacting with adjacent items
            and improved long-action handling.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pixel minimap for tiles mode.
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            Player stamina stat that is burned by running and other
            physical exertion.
          </li>
          <li>
            Player faction base that allows incremental growth and
            autonomous work by NPCs.
          </li>
          <li>
            The player remembers terrain and furniture they have seen.
          </li>
          <li>
            Carrying racks for small vehicles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Vehicle system (speed, fuel consumption, terrain effects)
            overhaul.
          </li>
          <li>
            Overhauled nutrition, food spoilage and food state changes
            (freezing).
          </li>
          <li>
            Overhauled bomb fragment handling.
          </li>
          <li>
            NPC dialogue support, group commands, tactical
            instructions and backstories.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dynamic Lighting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roughly DOUBLED the amount of in-game content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unheard-of levels of bugfixing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Full translations for Chinese, German, Japanese, Polish
            and Russian.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </description>
    </release>
    <release version="0.C Cooper" date="2015-03-09">
      <p>
        The Cooper release is named in honor of the new monster
        infighting system. Now you can sit back and watch as your
        enemies tear each other to pieces! Don’t get too close though,
        they’re still out for your blood.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This release also brings the long-requested DeathCam system,
          which lets you see the aftermath of the glorious fireball or
          atrocious train wreck that was your demise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gun users will notice a new aiming menu: you can now spend
          time to steady your aim. Do you take the shot now, or wait
          until the zombie gets a little closer?
        </li>
        <li>
          Tailoring-oriented survivors (and who isn’t?) will note the
          new tailor’s kit item, which lets you add insulation or
          protective patches to your clothes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Survivors with gigantic death-mobiles may appreciate the new
          turret options, including being able to enable/disable
          individual turrets, and being able to fire some turrets
          manually.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, for survivors with, shall we say, “well-stocked”
          bases, there are massive improvements to performance when
          there are many thousands of items nearby.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </release>
    <release version="0.B Brin" date="2014-11-17">
      <p>
        The Brin release is named in honor of significant improvements
        to PC/NPC relations.
      </p>
      <p>
        This release, containing over 9,000 commits (@kevingranade
        counted) brings an unheard-of amount of new features and
        content, most of which wants you dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start your adventure in a wide variety of different locations,
        with a selection of different starting scenarios, now with
        unique character traits. Explore new locations, some of which
        are ridiculously big (did somebody say ‘mall’?), and some of
        which have inhabitants that don’t want to eat you for a
        change. Vehicles have gotten some love, and now form a basis
        for an electrical network should you desire to build one. If
        you’ve ever wanted to strap a C4 pack onto an RC car and drive
        it under a Zombie Hulk, you got your chance.
      </p>
    </release>
    <release version="0.A Kaufman" date="2014-03-22">
      <p>
        The Kaufman is named in honor of a huge expansion to
        Cataclysm’s mutation system.  The release, our largest yet
        also brings innumerable bugfixes, performance enhancements,
        new items, a long-awaited module manager, new monsters,
        fullscreen mode, better mouse support, new map tiles and an
        unheard-of level of stability.
