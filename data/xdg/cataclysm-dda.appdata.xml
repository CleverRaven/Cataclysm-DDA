    <summary>A turn-based survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world.</summary>
    <description>
        <p>Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a roguelike set in a post-apocalyptic world. While some have described it as a
            "zombie game", there is far more to Cataclysm than that.</p>
        <p>Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistent, procedurally generated world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead
            civilization for food, equipment, or, if you are lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of gas to get you the
            hell out of Dodge. Fight to defeat or escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities, from zombies
            to giant insects to killer robots and things far stranger and deadlier, and against the others like
            yourself, that want what you have...</p>
