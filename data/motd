This branch contains much work by Creidieki, Uzername,
Kevingranade, HerbertJones, Gim, Shades, Origamiwolf,
 Darkling Wolf, zpmorgan, Voker57, OZoneH3, and RWJMurphy.
 A special thanks to Kevin and BurnZeZ for getting the
 larger view port working. Keep doing the impossible guys!

The game now has configurable options.
You can directly edit options.txt in the data directory, or
under the help section.

If you change the viewport(play area) size, you NEED to restart
for it to take effect.
