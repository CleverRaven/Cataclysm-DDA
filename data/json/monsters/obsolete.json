    "description": "The hideously deformed corpse of what, you hesitate to guess, was once either a mere child or adolescent.  Its skin has detached from its skeletal and muscular structure and has overgrown into a malformed fleshy chrysalis containing its rotting innards, with a faint glow emanating from within the creature’s swollen body as various lighter than air decomposing gasses are created and burned in a chain reaction.  This has caused its flesh, like a nightmarish balloon, to distend to obscene proportions, causing its overtaxed skin to become translucent and for the abomination to hover a few feet off the floor at any given moment.  All of the orifices in its head have sealed over into a transparent membrane, save for its narrow slit of a maw, from which a stream of noxious gas escapes; seemingly allowing the monstrosity to regulate its buoyancy.  From within its immensely swollen body, you can just make out faint shadowy forms moving about.",

The beast’s skin, stretched to paper-thin levels by what you can only assume to be lighter than air decomposition caused gasses built up within it, has turned into a spongy fungal covering with intermittent hair-line cracks which let out spores.  Like a nightmarish balloon the abomination is suspended off the floor with a faint glow emanating from within its guts, more than likely a result of the burning putrid gasses which keep it afloat.
