    "description": "a twisted corpse, twitching as its extremities distort and fade from the plains of perception.  As you watch, bloodied flesh splits, bones splinter, and organs rupture as it’s seemingly gutted by some unseen presence.  As soon as the body is reduced to a mutilated, writhing mass, it’s almost as if time reverts itself, mending the damage before the cycle begins anew.  Though this thing, which used to be a person, is unmoving save for the spasms of its repeated deaths, its gaze is locked upon you, mutely begging for release from its misery.",

Before any drops can mark the ground, time reverts, and the soldier returns to its original position and condition.  Agony-filled eyes lock upon you, silently begging you for help before the orbit of their skull is cracked like an egg shell.",

It jerks back and collapses, its small limbs bending and bones snapping before time appears to reverse.  Wounds close and bones mend before the never-ending cycle begins again.  In the small window of time before its head gets torn from its roots, its pained eyes plead for release.",
