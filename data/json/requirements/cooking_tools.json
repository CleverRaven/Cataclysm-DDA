    "//5": "Note: recipies involving water may require water_boiling_heat because it can potentially use unclean water, such as energy needed to cook some noodles or an egg.  Others such as bread baking don't need it because the water hits boiling temp, even though it does not boil.",

    "//7": "Ovens are terrible, this is intentional.  Typical oven uses 3x the wattage of a microwave, and bakes for often over 10x as long as the microwave does.  We cannot account for batch energy savings (multiple things in same oven) nor keeping the oven at temp (many kJ are wasted bringing it up to temp, unlike with a microwave) so efficiency is somewhat generously 0.2x that of microwave.",
    "//8": "A good way to judge input needed is how many seconds it takes to microwave.  1kW is a good estimate for microwave power usage, and the ratios are relatively consistent between different foodstuffs.",
