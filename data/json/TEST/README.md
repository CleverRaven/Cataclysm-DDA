# Test JSON Data #

JSON files placed within `data/json/TEST` should only contain data for testing.
None of the items, recipes, or other content here should appear in-game except
through debug-spawning.

Use a lowercase `test_` prefix for all `id` strings, and an all-caps `TEST` prefix
in the `name` field, to clearly distinguish them from "real" (live in-game) data.
