      "Not much to it.  I worked here as a logger before <the_cataclysm> began.  When all went to hell, I was on the job and had to hole up here with my coworkers.  Good news is we all came out fine, and the boss decided to keep the mill running.  I don't know how much longer we can last, though; not unless we make some contact with other people.  Customers, I guess you might call 'em.",

      "I'm a lumberjack out here.  Things were quiet for a long time.  We're pretty far out in the woods so it was kind of a shock to find out just how bad it'd gotten in civilization.  We had a couple close run-ins ourselves.  My friend over there almost got eaten!  But we still have resources that I'm sure people can use.",
      "My comrades and I were lucky to be in the right place at the right time, I suppose.  We keep really busy out here, so we didn't expect <the_cataclysm> to land right in our lap like that.  Luckily these axes can chop more than wood.  They'll take a good chunk out of anything nasty that threatens our mill.",
      "Well, I work here.  Welcome to the mill.  Used to be trucks in and out of here all the time but you're the first face we've seen in a while.",
      "New to the job… or, well, whatever's happening now.  I still cut trees and run logs through the saw from time to time, so I guess you'd call me a logger.  Things have only gotten weirder after those fucking <zombies> nearly killed us.  I'm not sure how much longer we'll last…"
