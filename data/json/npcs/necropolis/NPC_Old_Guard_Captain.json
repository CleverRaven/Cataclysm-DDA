If we are successful, this facility can be cleared and used as a permanent base of operations in the region.

The vault can support several thousand people for a few years if all systems are operational and sufficient notification is given.  Unfortunately, the power system was damaged or sabotaged at some point and released a single extremely lethal burst of radiation.  The catastrophic event lasted for several minutes and resulted in the deaths of most people located on the 2nd and lower floors.  Those working on this floor were able to seal the access ways to the lower floors before succumbing to radiation sickness.  The only other thing the logs tell us is that all water pressure was diverted to the lower levels.",
