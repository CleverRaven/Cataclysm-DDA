I manage what we have left and do everything I can to increase our supplies.  Rot and mold are more significant in the damp basement so I prioritize non-perishable food, such as cornmeal, jerky, and fruit wine.",

We have a local farmer or two and a few hunter types that have been making attempts to provide us with the nutritious supplies.  We do always need more suppliers though.  Because this stuff is rather cheap in bulk I can pay a premium for any you have on you.  Canned food and other edibles are handled by the merchant in the front.",
