When that is complete, you can expand the camp in a variety of ways:\n  1.  You can build up to 5 more rooms or shacks, 3 on each side of the camp.\n  2.  You can build a central building in the south half of the camp, between the rooms.  The central building will act as a command center, allowing your camp to perform hunting, recruiting, and combat patrol missions.\n  3.  You can dig trenches on all sides of the camp, which can possibly connect to the rooms on the sides to minimize the amount of trenching you need to do.\n  4.  You can build various small features such as root cellars to preserve food or a radio tower to make it easier to recruit more companions.\n  Each new construction in a modular camp can be made from a different material, so you aren't constrained by what you start with.  Tents are fast to put up, but fragile and likely to get destroyed by zombies.
