Not all activities can be done at every camp - you may need to build some additional buildings, or expand the camp, to get access to some missions.\n  Some faction camp missions can be duplicated by companion activities, but building up the camp can only be done via faction camp missions, as only completion of camp construction missions are recognized as fulfillment of those goals.\n  You assign missions by interacting with the bulletin board.  You'll see a list of available missions for your central camp tile.  If your camp has expansions, you can tab through the expansions to see the available missions at each expansion.\n  Remember, companions on camp missions need to be fed, and will become angry if they complete a mission but there isn't any food in the larder.\n  There is one special mission called 'Emergency Recall'.  You can use this to retrieve any companion on a faction camp mission, but this cancels the mission and wastes any resources used on it.

I may have forgotten something here, as my memory may not be completely up to date.  There used to be an additional one called the primitive field camp, but you can't start those anymore, only upgrade them.\n  The bare bones camp is the most flexible kind of camp as it can be built anywhere and doesn't mandate any construction.  Modular field camps is the next most flexible kind of camp since you can build them on any field and can locate them to have plenty of space for expansions, but you start with nothing in a field and have to build every building, so they can require a lot of resources.  Building upgrade camps are faster to build since you start in an existing building, but you have to establish them in a supported type of existing building and there may not be limited or no space for expansions.\n  Each camp location will have a variety of upgrade missions for it, except for the bare bones one where everything is up to you.  The various missions have descriptions.  In general, though, you'll need to establish housing if you want to expand, and some missions such as hunting or recruiting will require that you have some kind of kitchen or office that you can use to help schedule activities.\n  Regardless of what kind of camp you make, you have to start it by asking a companion to build the camp.

    "dynamic_line": "The Modular field camp is the second most flexible kind of camp, but they require a lot of time and resources to build.  There are actually two different versions with slightly different layouts, so you will always have a choice when starting a field base camp.  With both versions you start with an empty field - and it has to be a real empty field, not a field on a ranch or farm - and build up from nothing.  You have a range of different building materials available from which buildings can be constructed, and different sections can be constructed from different materials to make the most of what you have available.\n  You start by building a lean-to and a bed in the northeast corner of the central camp, and then add a cooking facility to it, and expand out until you have a small shelter for two people.  When that is complete, you can expand the camp in a variety of ways:\n  1.  You can build up to 5 more rooms or shacks, 3 on each side of the camp in version 1, and a total of 8  in version 2.\n  2.  You can build a central building in the south half of the camp, between the rooms in version 1, with version 2 having the central building in the center, shaping the camp into an 'H'.  The central building will act as a command center, allowing your camp to perform hunting, recruiting, and combat patrol missions.\n  3.  In version 1 only you can dig trenches on all sides of the camp, which can possibly connect to the rooms on the sides to minimize the amount of trenching you need to do.\n  4.  You can build various small features such as root cellars to preserve food or a radio tower to make it easier to recruit more companions.\n  As mentioned, each new construction in a modular camp can be made from a different material, so you aren't constrained by what you start with.  Tents are fast to put up, but fragile and likely to get destroyed by zombies.  The central building has to be made from a 'real' building material, while the rooms can be made from tents.  A final difference between version 1 and version 2 is that version 1 requires you to have at least one bed for the first expansion, and an additional two beds for each of the following expansions, while version 2 allows you to survey all expansions immediately.  Since version 1 constructs only 16 beds, this means it's restricted to have at most 6 expansions.",

    "dynamic_line": "A camp can have up to 8 expansions (one for each of the 8 adjacent overmap tiles).  Most base camps restrict the number of available expansions to one per two beds, while a few bypass that expansion (this is noted in their descriptions).  Expansions add to the capabilities of your camp, such as adding a farm field or a manufactory for crafting all kinds of things.\n  Expansion missions show up in separate tabs in the bulletin board, one set of missions per location, and you'll need to hit 'tab' to see them.  Some base camps have dedicated expansions tailored to their specific facilities, and while these might be accessible from other base camps should those be constructed adjacent to one of these, the set of reasonably general expansions are currently all limited to field locations.  The currently available general expansions are:\n  -- Farm: This is a full tile of plowed fields that you can maintain or send companions on missions to maintain.  Plants grow here normally.  This expansion exists in two versions.\n  -- Garage: This is a large building that currently doesn't provide any functionality, and so is of limited use (it used to provide disassembly before that was supported via zones).  This expansion exists in two versions.\n  -- Canteen: This is an expanded kitchen, dining area, and pantry that provides an expanded set of companion cooking recipes.  This expansion exists in two versions.\n  -- Livestock Area: This is a modular set of buildings for holding livestock such as cows, horses, or chickens.  Animals are not included!  This expansion exists in two versions.\n  -- Saltworks Area: This is a small expansion for processing salt.  This expansion creates a local mini swamp for salt extraction and exists in only one version.\n  -- Fabrication Workshop: This is a large expansion for doing all kinds of crafts.  Companions can use some of the furniture in this expansion to craft some items much faster than you can do by yourself by hand.  This expansion exists in two versions.\n  -- Central Storage Building: This is a large building for storing goods.  This expansion exists in two versions, the second of which allows the construction of storage furniture with a larger capacity than storage on the ground.\n  Note that there is nothing stopping you from constructing more than one instance of an expansion, such as multiple farms for more farming, or a second Livestock expansion if you have a lot of animals.  In most cases there is not much value in having more than one of an expansion, though.",

A modular field camp can be very resource intensive, but building one up allows you to send companions off to hunt and farm for you, so there's quite the pay-off.  What kind of camp (or camps) you want to build depends both on what you intend to focus on and whether you want to be stationary or roaming with stops in areas only for some time before moving on.  If nothing else, you should consider building a water well as soon as you can, which may require you to perform construction prerequisites.\n  If you have access to a fire station or evac shelter, you may want to build your camp in them.  Both of those camps are are very compact, but have much of the same functionality as an upgraded field camp without requiring so many resources.\n  If you are adding expansions to your camp, consider starting with a farm, canteen, or fabrication workshop.  The farm makes it easy to grow your own food if you don't have any ready plowed farms nearby, the canteen provides you with a well and root cellars after some upgrades, while the fabrication workshop can allow you to craft some of the resources you need to upgrade your camp.\n  The livestock area, storage area, and saltworks probably shouldn't be your first expansions, but they all have their uses.",
