I thought that one of the survivors had lit it to indicate their location.  As you can see, I was right.  I managed to find a boat near the nearest shore, on which I set sail.",

That way of life provided me with sufficient safety from the <zombies>, and I managed to get around the sea creatures deftly.  When I saw a distant light, at first, I could not believe my eyes.  Then, I decided to find out what it is."

I couldn't fight off him and he dragged my ship to the bottom.  The waves brought me straight to the shore of this little island.  I still don't understand by what miracle I managed to survive, <name_g>.",
