I was stuck in my cell when the cops all started yelling about an emergency, geared up, and left me in there with just a dumb-ass robot for a guard. I was stuck in there for two god-damn days, with no food and only a little water. Then this big-ass zombie busted in, and started fighting the robot. I didn't know what the fuck to think, but in the fighting they smashed open my cell door, and I managed to slip out.",
