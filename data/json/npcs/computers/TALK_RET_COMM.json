I wanted to give you an update on Shady Hills' official stance on the security and safety of our esteemed residents.  We are doing everything in our power to keep you safe from harm.  We understand the news has been frightening lately with talk of violence in the streets.  Rest assured you are safe inside of our neighborhood.  Out of an abundance of caution we are installing a new front gate to the entrance of the neighborhood.  This gate will keep back even the most violent of criminals.  Should you have any questions or concerns, please contact our service portal.\n\n  Thank you for your trust in Shady Hills,\n Randolph VanBuren",

I'll have to come check out your panic room sometime!  A few of us are going to check out the cave in the park if you want to join us.  Officially, it's supposed to be off limits, but what are they going to do about it?  I heard it even connects to the sewers, maybe if the world really goes to hell like they're all thinking, we can make use of it!  I'm kidding, I don't believe that crap.",
