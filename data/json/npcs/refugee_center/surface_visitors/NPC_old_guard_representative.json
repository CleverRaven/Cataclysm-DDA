However, our communication with the wasteland is lacking at best and nonexistent at worst.  We need to broaden our reach to intercept and send radio broadcasts.  Unfortunately Radio Towers are out of the question to widen our broadcasts, as the emergency grid for them is out of action.  However, Radio Stations in towns or urban areas should still have some juice left.  I want you to install something called a \"radio repeater mod\" in these stations that can broaden their reach and allow them to pick weaker signals.
