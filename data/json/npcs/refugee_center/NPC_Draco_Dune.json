Folks have been missing the little things in life.  New shoes, new cellphones, can't exactly go shopping, or, well, I guess you sorta can, if you mind the broken glass.  I left my wallet in an outdoorsman's store when I 'bought' this warmer coat.  Figured that's kinda it, you know?  It didn't matter anymore.  I don't think my insurance's going to pay out for any health care I get anymore.  I did what you see in the movies though, I rolled one up in a hundred dollar bill.  Ended up coughing and rerolling it in regular paper though.  Was too harsh.  Just letting you know in case you get the smart idea of trying it.

Say, I don't mean to get you in any trouble or nothing, but you haven't seen any green around town, have ya?  
What?
WHAT.
Oh yeah, some people've been growing it in their basements.
I'm not comfortable with where this is going.

"What it comes down to is, what do we do now?  Some folks have asked when the cavalry is coming.  I ask, when do we admit that we're it?"



(If you decide to go with him buying marijuana from you, btw, I was thinking of him commenting that it helps him relax but also helps with his joints. He's supposed to be a bit older, early fifties or so)
