My pants, my money, my many illegal imported triple magnum condoms I stole from a priest.  All lost to that one beautiful night.  The candles, the balloons, the singing.  It was the most romantic childrens' birthday party you could hope to imagine.  I would do it all again, and there was so much we did.  It was the end of that party, but the beginning of something beautiful, for several hours in that open minivan we found.  But you do not want to hear of such pleasures, I do not want to get you excited, for what can I do when I look so foolish, and lack the protection needed for more serious excitement.

I'd be mad, but at least I'm safe, I made it here.  But I got no game here y'know?  I look like the clown when I should be knee deep in hotness here.  Look around, it's straight hotties!"
