The design should be capable of auto or semi-auto fire, at a range that's pretty comparable to a gunpowder-based weapon.  It takes out some of the most limited parts of ranged weapons: no gunpowder, no brass casings, just lead that we melt into my mold.  It's not soundless, but it's not as loud as a chemical weapon.

Fatima and I work together a fair bit, and I consider Dana, Draco, and Aleesha my friends, and so of course I've gotten to know Dana's husband Pedro too.  The Borichenkos are their own sweet brand of messed up, like all of us.  The Singhs have each other, and keep mostly to themselves.  Vanessa and I don't see eye to eye, but I'm still glad she's here.  Uyen and Rhyzaea are always bickering about leadership decisions, as if they made those kind of calls.

The balance is way off right now, a hard day of work barely gets you enough to fill your belly.  I shouldn't bitch too much though.

We just kinda click as friends, I'm grateful there's someone else here I can really get along with.  Her husband, Pedro, is still pretty shell-shocked.  He doesn't talk much.  I like him though, when he opens up he's just hilarious.  Draco is just a cantankerous old fart who hasn't actually got old yet, give him twenty years and he'll be there.  I like grumpy people.  We also have pretty similar taste in music.  Aleesha's a sweet kid, and we've all kind of adopted her, but she seems to hang out with me and Dana the most.  She's a great artist, and she's full of crazy ideas.  I guess I like her because of all of us, she seems to have the most hope that there's a future to be had.",

Alonso is just a… he's… there's no polite word for what he is.  A lot of the others are fine with it, and okay, sure, I guess.  John is a walking stereotype, but he's a great poker buddy.
