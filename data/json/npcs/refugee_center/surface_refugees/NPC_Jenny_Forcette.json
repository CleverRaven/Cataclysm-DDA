That has to feel really weird, and I think it's made them stick really close together.  I think... I think they also just don't really like any of us.",

One of these days one of us is probably going to brain the other with a tire iron, and I'm just grateful I spend more time around the tire irons.  Uyen and Rhyzaea are both excellent people, and I genuinely like them, but I can't stand this ongoing political bullshit they've got going on.  Alonso is just a... he's... there's no polite word for what he is.  A lot of the others are fine with it, and okay, sure, I guess.  John is a walking stereotype, but he's a great poker buddy.  I admit I kinda like him.",

Uyen and Rhyzaea both seem to want to run the show here, but I try to stay out of those politics and just focus on building stuff.  I don't see much good coming of it.  Alonso is fine, he's clearly interested in me, and also in every other single woman here.  Not my thing, in a group this small.  John is a walking stereotype, I imagine there must be more depth to him, but I haven't seen it yet."
