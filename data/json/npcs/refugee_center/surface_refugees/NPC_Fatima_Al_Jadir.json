My parents aren't very traditional either, but my grandparents are really old fashioned and strict.  My sister came out as gay and they made her life really hard; mom and dad thought she should keep it secret, but she didn't believe in that.  I always loved mechanics and working with my hands, so when they started harassing my parents about getting my sister and I married off to nice men so we'd stop being so immoral, I decided to pick a job I liked that would bother them as much as possible.  It was a good choice, not only did it make them livid but I love welding.  I love the feel of standing back and looking at my work, knowing I took a few chunks of scrap metal and made them into something useful.  I love how it feels to make it fit together perfectly.  It just puts me at peace.\n\nIâ€¦ I do hope my grandparents are okay though.  They were old fashioned, and they made choices I didn't like, but they were family and I still have sweet memories of them from when I was little.  I've had to do a lot more thinking about God since <the_cataclysm>, and while I'd never agree with the decisions they made, I understand more why they thought they had to make them.  They just wanted the whole family to share their relationship with God, in their messed up way.",

With things still so difficult, it helps to know He's got some plan for me.\n\nAnyway, mine was the second bus to arrive, and they were just getting some triage and processing stuff set up.  I was put in charge of helping with the wounded, along with Uyen.  Things went a little strange later onâ€¦ one of the women doing triage and processing had a bit of a hang-up about particular, um, colors of people being allowed into the center.  She claimed to have lost our 'papers', along with a lot of other peoples'.
