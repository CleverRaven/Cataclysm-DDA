My brother came out as trans and they made his life hell.  I always loved mechanics and working with my hands, so I decided to pick a job I liked that would piss them off as much as possible.  It was a good choice, not only did it make them livid but I love welding.  I love the feel of standing back and looking at my work, knowing I took a few chunks of scrap metal and made them into something useful.  I love how it feels to make it fit together perfectly.  It just puts me at peace...\n\nI... I do hope they're okay though.  They were bigoted, racist assholes, but they were family and I still have sweet memories of them from when I was little."

I'd been a little out of touch for a bit and didn't realize how bad the rioting was getting.  When my bus arrived it got repurposed into an evacuation vehicle, and took me here.  It was the second bus to arrive, and they were just getting some triage and processing stuff set up.  I was put in charge of helping with the wounded, along with Uyen.  Things went a little funky later on... one of the women doing triage and processing had a bit of a hang-up about particular, um, colors of people being allowed into the center.  She claimed to have lost our 'papers', along with a lot of other peoples'.  Thankfully because we'd helped so many we were able to argue that they could't leave us out, but there was no space left downstairs by the time we got that sorted, so here we are."
