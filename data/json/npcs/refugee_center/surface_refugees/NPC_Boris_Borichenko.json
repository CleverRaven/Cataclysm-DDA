Boris goes through several, proudly showing how his son learned little lighting tricks, or reminiscing on the time his son showed him the art.  After a while, he stops commenting and just continues quietly clicking through photos.  He seems different in the glow of the screen, like several years dropped away from his face, despite the deep sadness still etched there.]",

In it are numerous text files containing smatterings of stream-of-conscious notes, copy-and-pasted bits of fanfictions, notes about how to write a novel, and more.  The story itself is a handful of poorly fleshed out chapters written with the quality level you'd expect from a grade schooler.  Nonetheless it's quite impressive that there's this much stuff on a single topic.  Boris talks for a while about dinner conversations for weeks that would focus on Ash's ideas for his stories.  After a while, he trails off and just continues flipping through the files, reading silently.]",
