Her father was a real nut, he'd rave on and on about an apocalypse he'd prepared for.  He always thought that his church would be the ark to weather the storm, that God would destroy the world by unleashing the armies of Hell; and he wasn't talking about the Second Coming of Christ.  Helena's just as fanatical as he was, and it reflects in her inadequate leadership.  To be honest, I'm highly concerned for some of the people here; they're obsessively zealous with Helena, and harbor a xenophobic hatred of everything.  As in Matthew 15:14, 'They are blind guides.  And if one blind person guides another, they will both fall into a pit'.\"",
