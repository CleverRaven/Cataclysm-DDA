Start by rinsing the needles, and separating any woody parts from them.  Then, cut the pine needles in half.  Add one bough's worth of chopped needles to a cup or mug and fill it with boiling water.  Let the needles steep for ten minutes, until they turn brownish and sink down to the bottom.  As a final step, you can strain the needles, but then you'd be wasting precious calories.
