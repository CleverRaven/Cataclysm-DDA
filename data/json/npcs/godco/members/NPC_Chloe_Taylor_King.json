I kinda didn't want to go alone but I also didn't want the rioters to eat me, so I asked Sonia - my neighbor - to evacuate with me, I guess.  So that was fun; escaping my hometown, walking down the country road, waiting for a horror to ambush us.  Spoiler alert: we were attacked.  So this zombie shambles in front of us and Sonia whacks it real hard with her guitar!  Its brain splatters all over the pavement, I threw up 'cause it was so disgusting.  We got here soon after that.  My parents weren't here, obviously.  Oh man, they must worry about me so much…",
