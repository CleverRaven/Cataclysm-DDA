I kinda didn't want to go alone but I also didn't want the rioters to eat me, so I asked Sonia - my neighbor - to evacuate with me, I guess.  So that was fun; escaping my hometown, walking down the country road, waiting for a horror to ambush us.  Spoiler alert: we were attacked.  So this zombie shambles in front of us and Sonia whacks it real hard with her guitar!  Its brain splatters all over the pavement, and it was super cool, but I also vomited because it was really disgusting.  We got here soon after that.  My parents weren't here, obviously.  Oh man, they must worry about me so much…",
