I've spent a good portion of my life warning others of the fakery that is plastic medicine and helping them rediscover the forgotten beauty that lies in our surroundings.  I joined the New England Church Community to express my gratitude towards the benevolence of nature.  This is where it brought me.",

Start by rinsing the needles, and separating any woody parts from them.  Then, cut the pine needles in half.  Add one bough's worth of chopped needles to a cup or mug and fill it with boiling water.  Let the needles steep for ten minutes, until they turn brownish and sink down to the bottom.  As a final step, you can strain the needles, but then you'd be wasting precious calories.  A drink like this is perfect for mid-winter colds.",
