On its own, it doesn't look like much; it resembles the body of a service rifle without a stock or barrel, colored in sleek black with blue highlights around the magazine well.  Small yellow arrows and inscriptions are present at certain points, highlighting the fasteners used to assemble the thing in earnest.  Accompanying the Platform itself is a series of four bundles of parts for it, each held together using velcro strips and tagged by caliber.  A drawstring nylon bag, embroidered with the Hub's logo and filled with proprietary tools, completes the whole package.\n\nAll in all, not a bad deal.\n\n\"Should you require magazines of any given caliber, we are willing to provide them through standard requisitions.

The opportunity to research - and perhaps understand - technology from not only another world, but another dimension entirely, is an exceptionally promising field of study.
