I know it might sound pretty crazy, but I believe that the prophecies of the old ways had something to them, especially now with the craziness that's going on.  If that's correct, why wouldn't the other parts of it be too?  I believe that a return to these old ways will help us, and bring us closer to the Gods.  Odin the Allfather will smile on me when I die, and everyone I brought with me along this journey.",

When these two came together, the ice melted and became the first of the giants, Ymir.  As he slept, more giants sprung from his sweat and saliva.  From the melt came the cow Audhumla, who licked away the ice until she uncovered Buri, the first of the gods.  His children were Odin, Vili, and Ve; who slew Ymir to fashion the world from him.  They made the first people, Ask and Embla.  Odin fashioned all things which we see, but the destructive giants opposed and fought him; these undead which invaded the earth came from Hel as an army of the dead during Ragnarok.  As foretold in Vafthrúdnismál, Vidar and some of the younger generation of gods will create a new world.  Only then shall we undo <the_cataclysm>, and fashion the world anew.",
