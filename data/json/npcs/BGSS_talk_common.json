Well, I managed to sneak over that way, and saw them dumping load after load of the dead in the pit, pouring dirt back over them even as they revived and tried to climb out.  Even with all the shit I've seen since, it haunts me.  I knew then I had to get out.  Luckily for me, we were attacked the next morning by some giant horror, a kind I haven't really seen since then.  While the guards were busy with that, I grabbed some supplies I'd stocked up over the night and I fucked right out of there.  A few others tried to fuck out with me, but as far as I know I was the only lucky one.",

That was before someone switched them to kill everybody, back when it only killed trespassing humans.  Good times, you can always trust bureaucracy to fuck things up in the most spectacular way possible.  Anyway, the house itself was half collapsed, a SWAT van had plowed into it.
