I'm never going to kill all the zombies out there.  Darius and I try not to fight if we can avoid it, and if we can't, we try to always have the advantage.  Numbers, weaponry, terrain.  Zombies are clumsy and stupid so we lead them across bushes and things to trip and stumble.  We take high ground and let them plough into ladders like idiots while we stick 'em with spears from above.  Mostly, though, we try not to be seen.  We use bikes instead of cars because they don't make noise and don't need gas, plus we can take forest trails and things and avoid traffic jams.  Those things are suicide.  We try to avoid the cities, and when we do go close, we stick to the outskirts and raid the outlying houses.  In those, we keep crouched and try to get deep into the building fast, or down into the basement, so that little noises don't carry much and nothing from outside can see us.  Also, zombies being idiots, closing the blinds is a great move.  I always keep a crowbar for opening doors and windows, but I try not to use it if I can avoid it.  Darius can pick locks, which is slower but doesn't make noise.  We get a lot more mileage from raiding gas stations and other rural sites, where if there are a few zombies, we can usually lead them away.",

Did part of an electrical engineering degree, then decided it wasn't for me and quit that.  Spent a bit of time doing freelance electrical and programming work, then got recruited by a startup that was designing and programming medical equipment.  I was supposed to be a general technician, but through a weird series of events I wound up in sales, then management.  I hated management, and I'd made a big nest egg from my share stock, so I cashed out and tried to retire young.  That was a dumb move, I was bored as hell, so I finished off my degree and started doing on-call teaching work for shop, computers, math, and things like that at a college and high school level.
