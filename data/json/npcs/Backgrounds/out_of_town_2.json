I don't know exactly how the days line up...  our first clue that Armageddon had come was when we got blasted by some kind of poison wind, with a sort of acid mist in it that burnt our eyes and skin.  We weren't sure what to make of it so we went inside to rest up, and while we were in there a weird dust settled over everything.",
