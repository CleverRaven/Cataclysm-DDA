I think I was working there when things happened.  My first clear memory is running through the underbrush a few miles from town.  I was bandaged up, I had a messenger bag loaded with gear, and I'd taken a hard hit to the side of my head.  I have no idea what happened to me, but clearly I had already been on the run for a bit.",

To do more, like construct functioning models and such, I'd need a safe lab of my own, with quite a lot of fancy gear, and a reliable power grid.  I think that's a long way down the road.",
