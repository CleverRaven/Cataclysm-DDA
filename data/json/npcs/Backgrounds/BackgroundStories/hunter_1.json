Doesn't matter to me, I was out on my end-of-winter hunting trip, I'd been out of town for a week already.  First clue I had things were going wrong was when I saw a mushroom cloud out near an old abandoned military base, way out in the middle of nowhere.  I didn't think much about that.  Then I was attacked by a demon.",

That just pissed it off, but I got another couple shots off while it charged me.  Third or fourth shot took it down.  I figured out shit had hit the fan, somehow.  Headed to my cabin and camped out there for a while, but I had to skip out when a bunch of <zombies> showed up and trashed the place.  I ran into you not much later.",
