I can't imagine the university was a good place to be, given what I've heard about Bostonâ€¦  I'm not sure anyone made it out.  I was out at my cabin near Chatham, ostensibly working on the finishing touches for a paper, but mostly just sipping whisky and thanking my lucky stars for tenure.  Those were good days.  Then came <the_cataclysm>, the military convoys, the <zombies>.  My cabin was crushed by a <monster>, just collateral damage after it got blasted off Orleans by a tank.  I was already busy running frantically by then.",
