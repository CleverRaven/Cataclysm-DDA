You've probably seen it, the one where the woman turns to the camera and you can see her whole lower lip has been ripped off, and is just flapping there?  It got so bad, they went over the PA system to tell us about Chinese drugs in the water supply.  Right…  Does anyone buy that explanation?",

I wound up running more.  Stole a bike and ran more again.  I'm a bit better at killing those things now, but I haven't made it home yet.  I guess I'm afraid of what I'll find.",
