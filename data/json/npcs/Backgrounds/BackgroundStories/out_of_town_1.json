I finally wound up camping in the bushes off the side of the road; good thing, too, because a semi truck whipped by - dead driver, you know - and turned my car into a skid mark.  I feel bad for the bastards that were in the cities when it hit.",

I got caught in one of those hellish rainstorms, it started to burn my skin right off.  I managed to take shelter under a car, lying on top of my tent.  Wrecked the damn thing, but better it than me.  From what I hear, though, I got lucky.  That was pretty much the worst I saw.  I didn't run into any of those demon-monsters that I hear attacked the cities, so I guess I got off lucky.",

I tried to stay away from the roads, but I didn't want to get lost in the woods either, so I stuck to the deep margins.  I saw cars, buses, trucks loaded down with evacuees.  Plenty went right on, but a lot stalled out of gas and other stuff.  Some were so full of gear and people there were folks hanging off them.  Stalling out was a death sentence, because the dead were coming along the roads picking off the survivors.",
