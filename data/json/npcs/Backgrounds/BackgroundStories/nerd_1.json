We'd already heard about people coming back from the dead, actually that's why I was doing the RPG.  When the cops came to put the school on lockdown I managed to slip out the back.  I live a long way out of town, but there was no way I was going to take a bus home, so I walked.  Two hours.  Heard a lot of sirens, and I even saw jets overhead.  It was getting late when I got back, but my mom and dad weren't back from work yet.  I stayed there, hoping they'd come.  I sent texts but got no reply.  After a few days, well…  The news got worse and worse, then it stopped completely.",
