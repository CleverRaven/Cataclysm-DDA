I barely knew which end of the gun the bullets came out of, and they jammed me into a truck and drove me to Newport to 'assist in the evacuation efforts'.  Our orders barely made sense, our officers were as confused as we were.",

I didn't even see it, just saw this huge black-and-green spiny leg jam through the ceiling, through the el-tee.  Heard the tires grinding, felt the truck lift up.  We were kicked off the leg like dog shit off a sneaker.  I don't know how I survived.  The thing rolled over, killed most of us right there.  I musta blacked out for a bit.  Came to, and while I was getting myself out, the others started getting back up.  Long story short, I lived, they didn't, and I ran.",
