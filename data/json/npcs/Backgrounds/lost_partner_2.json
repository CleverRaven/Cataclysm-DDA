Some parts of the city were pretty tame at first.  There were a few chunks where people had been evacuated or cleared out, and the <zombies> didn't really go there.  Later on, others like me started moving into those neighborhoods, so I switched and started running through the blasted out downtown.  I had to anyway, to get home.  By the time I made the switch though, the fighting was starting to die off, and I was mostly just avoiding attention from zombies and other things.",

That was before someone switched them to kill everybody, back when it only killed trespassing humans.  Good times, you can always trust bureaucracy to fuck things up in the most spectacular way possible.  Anyway, the house itself was half collapsed, a SWAT van had plowed into it.
