The big guy was held back by his own horde of buddies, and I managed to book it back to my place.  I closed the windows, locked it down, but it was too late.  The giant followed me and just started hammering right through the walls.  I grabbed what I could and made for the horizon.  Last I saw of my squat, it was collapsing on the bastard.

I don't have a good guess what caused that.  I thought it was the usual stuff at first, and I gotta admit, I was sort of excited and scared it was the start of a revolution.  Not excited enough to join in though, and I guess anyone who was is probably dead now.  I tried to wait it out at home, packed a little bug-out bag, but then the internet started showing videos of rioters getting back up and fighting with crazy injuries.  I don't know how many people really believed it at first, but I took that as my sign and ditched town for the evac shelter.  I don't know exactly what happened after that.  The center I was in was heavily vandalized and empty, and I never saw anyone else.  The cell phone grid was locked up, except for one emergency message that came through around a day later saying the government had fallen.  Power went out a few days later.",
