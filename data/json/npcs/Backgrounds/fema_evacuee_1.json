A few of the folks on board the bus had injuries, and some schmuck who had seen too many B-movies tried to insist that anyone who 'had been bitten' was going to 'turn'.  Fucking idiot, right?  I've been bitten a dozen times now and the worst I got was a gross infection.",

There was an armed guy overseeing the transport, acting like a cop but really he was just some <dumb> kid they'd handed a rifle to.  He tried to calm things down, and I guess it actually worked for a bit, although the 'kill the infected' bunch were pretty <swear> freaked out and were clearly ready to jump the moment the granny with the cut on her arm started frothing at the mouth.  They started acting up again when we got to the camp.  That didn't go well for them.  A few heavily armed soldiers dragged them away, and I never saw them again.",

Well, I managed to sneak over that way, and saw them dumping load after load of the dead in the pit, pouring dirt back over them even as they revived and tried to climb out.  Even with all the shit I've seen since, it haunts me.  I knew then I had to get out.  Luckily for me, we were attacked the next morning by some giant horror, a kind I haven't really seen since then.  While the guards were busy with that, I grabbed some supplies I'd stocked up over the night and I fucked right out of there.  A few others tried to fuck out with me, but as far as I know I was the only lucky one.",
