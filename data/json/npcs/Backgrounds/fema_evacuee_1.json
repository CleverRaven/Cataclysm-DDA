They started acting up again when we got to the camp.  That didn't go well for them.  A few heavily armed soldiers dragged them away, and I never saw them again.",

Well, I managed to sneak over that way, and saw them dumping load after load of the dead in the pit, pouring dirt back over them even as they revived and tried to climb out.  Even with all the shit I've seen since, it haunts me.  I knew then I had to get out.  Luckily for me, we were attacked the next morning by some giant horror, a kind I haven't really seen since then.  While the guards were busy with that, I grabbed some supplies I'd stocked up over the night and I fucked right out of there.  A few others tried to fuck out with me, but as far as I know I was the only lucky one.",

My guess is they tried to de-educate us, tried to mislead us, and when that wasn't working they tried actual drugs in the water to make us stupid or something.  Instead of just stupid, some people got violent.  Then they tried to leverage that to put in martial law, but that didn't work and they wound up fighting hordes of people.
