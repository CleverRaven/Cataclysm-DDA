We all got the emergency broadcast on our cells, but I was the only one to read between the lines and see it for what it was: large scale bio-terrorism.  I wasn't about to stay and find out who of my coworkers was a sleeper agent.  Although I'd bet fifty bucks it was Lee.  Anyway, I stole the co-ordinator's pickup and headed straight for my shelter.",
