Pretty sure we killed more civilians.  Even among my crew, morale was piss poor and we were shooting wild.  Then something hit us, something big.  Might have been a bomb, I really don't remember.  I woke up pinned underneath the SWAT van.  I couldn't see anything… but I could hear it, <swear!>.  I could hear everything.  I spent hours, maybe days under that van, not even trying to get out.",

I decided to try to pull myself out and see how bad my injuries were.  It was <very> easy.  The side of the van was torn open, and it turned out I was basically just lying under a little debris, with the ruins of the van tented around me.  I wasn't even too badly hurt.  I grabbed as much gear as I could, and I slipped out.  It was night.  I could hear fighting farther away in the city, so I went the other way.  I made it a few blocks before I ran into any <zombies>… I ran from them.  I ran, and I ran, and I ran some more.  And here I am.",
