Last time I saw them alive, I just came home from school, grabbed a snack and went to work.  I don't think I even told my mom I loved her, and I was pissed at my dad for some <dumb> shit that really doesn't matter.  Didn't matter then, really doesn't now.  Things started going crazy while I was at work…  The military rolled into town, and the evacuation alert sounded.",
