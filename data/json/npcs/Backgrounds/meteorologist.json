In my free time I was studying electronics and radio engineering, a bit for work but mostly just as a hobby.  When the riots got serious, my neighborhood was looking pretty sketchy.  I gathered all my things that I managed to carry with me and settled in a radio station that seemed abandoned.  I lived there for a while, doing all sorts of nonsense, until I met you.  I guess you know the rest.",
