In recent years, I have worked at meteostation, monitored the weather, state of air, read and wrote reports, made schedulesâ€¦ In general, ordinary boredom. In my free time I was studying electronics and radio engineering, making various devices, some for work, some just for fun. When the first riots began, I gathered all my things that I managed to carry with me and settled in some radiostation. I lived there for a while, doing all sorts of nonsense, until I met you. Then you helped me make a drone, find out what happened to our state, and you persuaded me to go with you. Since then, I have followed you, trusting you with my life.",
