Next day, somebody bombed them.  No shit, just like Oklahoma city in '95.  Thought that was a good sign to get out so I emailed some family out in the country that I was coming over and got on the road.  Didn't even make it to the interstate before I ran into the cops setting up a roadblock.  I drove off the road and it all gets fuzzy from there.  Next town I got to was already lynching people from the streetlightsâ€¦ I didn't stop for gas.  Lost the car at some point, lost track of the days too.  Not sure I ever got a reply to my email.",
