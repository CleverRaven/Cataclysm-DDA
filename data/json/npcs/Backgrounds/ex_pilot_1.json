Next day, somebody bombed them.  No shit, just like Oklahoma city in '95.  Thought that was a good sign to get out so I emailed some family out in the country that I was coming over and got on the road.  Didn't even make it to the interstate before I ran into the cops setting up a roadblock.  I drove off the road and it all gets fuzzy from there.  Next town I got to was already lynching people from the streetlightsâ€¦ I didn't stop for gas.  Lost the car at some point, lost track of the days too.  Not sure I ever got a reply to my email.",

      "//~": "'pot' and 'mary jane' are both slang terms for marijuana, a recreational drug that's federally illegal in the US.  In several states, possessing more than a certain quantity of marijuana is considered 'possession with intent to distribute' and can incur a felony conviction. Some states also allow conviction records of non-violent drug offenses to be 'sealed' (restricted from being publicly published or considered by the court) if the convicted person does not commit further crimes.",
      "str": "Uh, well probably?  I flew fixed-wing for work, but my interest in flying was for helitack - uh, that's helicopter transport for firefighting teams.  Anyway, I got a stupid pot conviction and that disqualified me.  Took a job with the airline to keep fresh until I could finish probation and get the records sealed.  Funny, you smoke some mary jane and they say you can't save lives with firefighting.  But they'll let you fly a plane with hundreds of people in it, not like anyone's ever crashed one of those on purpose before.  So yeah, get me a helicopter and I'd be happy to fly."
