I was halfway to MIT for a conference when <the_cataclysm> stopped me.  I was staying at a flee-ridden little motel on the side of the road.  When I got up for whatever was going to pass for breakfast, the fat bloody proprietor was sitting at his desk, wearing the same grubby clothes from the night before.  I thought he had just slept there, but when he looked at me...  well, you know what those Zed-eyes look like.  He lunged, and I reacted without thinking.  Smacked him on the head with my tablet.",
