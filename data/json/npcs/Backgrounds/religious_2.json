Instead it was messy and dirty.  Riots in the streets, the military and police serving the Antichrist to gun down the people like - what was it my dad used to say - like wheat before the chaff?  Then when we'd really showed our Sin, God came in with the real plagues.  The dead started walking, getting up with machine gun holes in them to fight the military, and the military started turning on each other too.  After that, the legions of Hell itself came out.  Huge monsters, worse than anything I'd ever imagined, just tore through the cities ripping everything to shreds.  Then they started dying off as quick as they'd arrived, and we were left trying to run and hide from the undead.  A day or two later the power started going out.",
