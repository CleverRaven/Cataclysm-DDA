I had it pretty good though, I'd lifted a bunch of canned food and shit, and I had a pretty sweet little squat in that warehouse.  I'd been planning on spending a long time there after all, while I figured out how to get in good with my crew.",

I took a few shots at them but that creepy-ass motherfucker waves his hands and brings 'em back up, so I ran.
