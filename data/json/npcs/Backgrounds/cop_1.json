At some point one of the g-men on the phone told me it was a Chinese attack, something in the water supply...  I don't know if I believe it now, but at the time it was the best explanation.  At first it was weird, a few people - <zombies> - fighting like rabid animals.  Then it got worse.  I tried to control things, but it was just me and my deputies against a town in riot.  Then things really got fucked up.",

Got some civilians in the crossfire.  It started just devouring people like potato chips into a gullet that looked like a rotting asshole with teeth, and...  Well, I lost my nerve.  I ran.  I think I might have been the only person to escape.  I haven't been able to even look at my badge since then.",
