I got evacuated on to the local concentration center, then picked up on a repurposed school bus and dragged out to that shithole.  We heard the place was getting more people than they could fit, and the few who'd got there first had set up some sort of self-appointed processing lineup.  The chick processing me to get in saw my Chinese name and conveniently 'lost' my paperwork.  I was sent out to the lobby to wait for 'further processing', while I watched busloads of people get processed and taken in.  By the time they 'found' my paperwork, wouldn't you know it, the place was too full for me.  They oh-so-kindly let me camp out in the front since I'd been on one of the first buses.",
