I had my clothes, a splitting headache, and absolutely no memory of anything.  Like, I know stuff.  I can talk, I have skills and understanding… but I don't remember where any of it comes from.  I had a driver's license in my pocket and that's the only way I even know my name.",

Besides my driver's license, there were pictures of kids in my wallet… not that that sparked any reaction from me.  I didn't see any kids around.  Maybe losing my mind is a mercy.  Hell, maybe it's some kind of psychotic break and my brain did this to itself.  To be honest with you I think I'd rather focus on surviving, and not worry about it.",
