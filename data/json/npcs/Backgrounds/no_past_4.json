I was on the run from a big-ass hell zombie, running like I'd always been doing, when I found a steel baseball bat just laying on the ground.  I took it as a sign and beat that gooey bastard to a pulp... and that's when I became me.  I still run, because who doesn't, but I stand my ground now.",

It was arcing electricity through my bat so I dropped it and used a nearby two-by-four, but I wound up having to run and leave the ol' slugger behind.  I nearly died that day.",
