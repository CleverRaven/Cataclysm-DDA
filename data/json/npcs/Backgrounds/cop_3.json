I made a bad call in a drug bust and a scumbag got me right in the gut, it was barely stopped by my vest.  I took some pretty bad internal bruising.  I never thought getting shot would save my life, but I was off duty recuperating when the worst of it hit.",

Then a buddy of mine called me from just off the front lines.  He'd been hurt and he wasn't making much sense, but what he told me... well, you can imagine the kind of stuff he told me.  Everything the worst of the internet was making up, and more.  Instead of packing up to try to volunteer back onto active duty, I took his advice and packed up to leave.  My house was on the edge of town and the riots hadn't reached it yet, but from what I'd heard it was smarter to get out than to hold tight.  I slipped out that night and camped a few days in the woods, waiting for it to blow over.  It never did.",
