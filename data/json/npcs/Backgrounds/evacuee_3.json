Lots of really scary crimes, not your usual stuff but like cannibalism and some real unspeakable shit, you know?  When the riots started, I think I was already primed to think of it as something different from a normal equality riot or anything like that.  I think that's part of how I got out safer, I had had some time to get some stuff and get going, and didn't try to make shopping trips.  People were abso-fuckin-lutely crazy in those days.  It was a lot like the pandemic a few years back, except the police were out in the streets in force, gunning people down like it was going out of style.",

Worse stuff came out of course, and now we've both seen worse things with our own eyes, but that one still comes back to haunt me.  Anyway, they never could control the riots, and by the time the rioters started turning into undead it was way too late.  I don't know if morale just broke or what but I heard rumours the military and police started turning on each other as much as the crowds.  What actually made the dead come back to life though?  I haven't got a clue.",
