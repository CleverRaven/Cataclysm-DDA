I was stuck in my cell when the cops all started yelling about an emergency, geared up, and left me in there with just this <dumb> robot for a guard.  I was stuck in there for two god-damn days, with no food and only a little water.  Then this big-ass zombie busted in, and started fighting the robot.  I didn't know what the fuck to think, but in the fighting they smashed open my cell door, and I managed to slip out.",

Biggest worry wasn't the zombies and the monsters, honestly.  It was the fuckin' police robots.  They knew I was in violation, and they kept trying to arrest me.",
