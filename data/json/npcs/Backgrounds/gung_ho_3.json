I guess they think I'm dead, so they'll steer clear of this hellhole, and that's the best as could be.",

I started going up to check it out, and before I knew it they were opening fire!  I coulda died, but I still have pretty good reactions.  I turned tail and rolled out of there.  My Hummer had taken some bad hits though, and I found out the hard way I was leaking gas all down the freeway.  Made it a few miles before I wound up stuck in the ass-end of nowhere.  I settled in to wander.  I guess I'm still kinda heading North, just by a pretty round-about way, you know?",

I read a news article, apparently that was all a front for some other kind of secret weapon they were working on.  Made so much energy, there was no way to hide it, so they made it a story about fusion power instead.  That'd explain why we never saw fusion power Stateside, don't you think?  And if they were that much more advanced that they could make fusion power, who knows what else they could make.",
