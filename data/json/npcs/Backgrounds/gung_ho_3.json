I started going up to check it out, and before I knew it they were opening fire!  I coulda died, but I still have pretty good reactions.  I turned tail and rolled out of there.  My Hummer had taken some bad hits though, and I found out the hard way I was leaking gas all down the freeway.  Made it a few miles before I wound up stuck in the ass-end of nowhere.  I settled in to wander.  I guess I'm still kinda heading North, just by a pretty round-about way, you know?",
