Honestly I probably should have gone to the hospital, except then I guess I'd be dead now.  I don't know what was a dream and what was the world ending.  I remember heading to the fridge for a drink and noticing the light was out and the water was warm, I think that was a bit before my fever broke.  I was still pretty groggy when I ran out of chicken soup, so it took me a while to really process how dark and dead my building was when I headed out.",

Once I stepped outside I realized what was going on, or realized I didn't know what was going on at least.  I saw a bunch of rioters smashing a car, and then I noticed one of them was bashing a woman's head in.  I canceled my grocery trip, ran back to my apartment before they saw me, and holed up there for as long as I could.  Things got comparatively quiet as the dead started to outnumber the living, so I started looting what I could from my neighbors, re-killing them when I had to.  Eventually the <zombies> overran my building and I had to climb out and head for the hills on an old bike.",

Like, remember a few years back there was that big thing online about an alien body found in the ice?  I don't know if you remember but it was all over the news for a while until it turned out to be a hoax.  Only, since then, I've seen some aliens walking around that look a *lot* like that ice body.  Maybe it wasn't a hoax, maybe that was a cover-up.  So, maybe those aliens had some kind of virus.  It went around the world and infected everything silently until, somehow, it activated and caused the violence and monsters and mutations.",
