I bet it wouldn't take long to get enough food and supplies to live on forever, and then I'd just let myself turn into some kinda wild bush man, with a big crazy long beard.  I'd smell like weed and B.O. and I'd have this giant stack of books to read.  Other survivors would come find me, like a guru on a mountaintop, to ask me questions about Batman.
