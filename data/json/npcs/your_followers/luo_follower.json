The chick processing me to get in saw my Chinese name and conveniently 'lost' my paperwork.  I was sent out to the lobby to wait for 'further processing', while I watched busloads of people get processed and taken in.  By the time they 'found' my paperwork, wouldn't you know it, the place was too full for me.  They oh-so-kindly let me camp out in the front since I'd been on one of the first buses.",
