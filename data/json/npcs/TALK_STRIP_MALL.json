With the recent events as they are, we must do our utmost to ensure that our goals remain priority.\n\n Branch Managers - your deliveries will have an altered schedule.  I will send a separate email with details.  Ensure the hidden safe rooms are properly secured.\n Community Managers - Lockdown the community appropriately.  Tell the residents that it is for their protection, but do not let them leave.  We need them for the Big Pappy project to be successful.  I am going to send you some contacts who can discreetly install a heavy security gate.\n\n You will continue to receive your bonus pay as agreed upon.  Do not lose sight of our important endgame.",
