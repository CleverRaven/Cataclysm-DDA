As long as we keep it clean and do our part when a zombie comes, they let us squat here as an extra defense.  They don't like that I've been bringing food for the other squatters though...  I think they are trying to slowly starve us out, and even though I can't keep everyone's bellies full, I've been able to bring back enough to keep these folk in better shape.  I suspect they'll find an excuse kick me out eventually.",
