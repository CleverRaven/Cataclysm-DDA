    "description": "A waist-length overcoat with an integral chemical hood, an expandable pocket sewn into the left sleeve, and Velcro fastenings on the wrists and zipper, this ripped and torn jacket used to form half of the US military’s CBRN JSLIST overgarment.  Constructed with an inner layer of carbon discs to keep harmful chemicals from penetrating through the suit and a selectively permeable membrane meant to let perspiration escape, its intended role has been rendered void by the large amounts of lacerations that coat it, allowing any biohazard to infiltrate the coat unimpeded.  It's little more than a glorified jacket at this point, and not even a particularly good one at that; you’d be better off just discarding it.",
