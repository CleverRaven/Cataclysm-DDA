Constructed with an inner layer of carbon discs that keep harmful chemicals from penetrating through the suit and a selectively permeable membrane that lets perspiration escape, the garment’s meant to be either worn over a regular uniform or alone for maximum breathability.  This one is currently unzipped and casually worn with rolled-up sleeves and a tucked-away hood.  If you don’t enjoy collecting biohazards within your organs, you’d probably be best off avoiding contaminated areas until you’ve suited back up.",
