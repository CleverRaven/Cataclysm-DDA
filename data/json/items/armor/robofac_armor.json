Striped in brown and blue, the white seal of Hub 01 is emblazoned proudly on the front.  It features several quick access pouches attached to a waist drawstring, and two waterproof dry bags for carrying liquids.  It also features several tight clamps and velcro strips around the waist and shoulders; perhaps something attaches to them.",

    "//2": "Why no PALS? Fundamentally PALS is a decent system but adds a pile of additional weight in straps and fasteners, they also unless very well designed aren't particularly low profile and can catch on stuff. It's fun for a game but in the real world you can just buy a bag with the pockets and utility you want, or as the current fad in Tacticool Operators ™️  go with a micro rig or a dedicated pre pocketed harness. So for military use where you are expected to carry 270 rounds of ammo weight is a lot less splitting hairs. In an apocalypse scenario where you will be moving on foot, potentially with low calories to supplement and no chain of resupply that weight can really matter.",
