    "description": ".223 Remington ammunition with 55gr FMJ-BT bullets, patterned after the M193 loading.  The .223 round has been very popular with civilian shooters for almost a century, finding use in a wide variety of weapons.  The combination of high velocity with a thinly jacketed, cannelured projectile led to unexpected yaw and fragmentation in soft tissue, increasing this round's performance.",
