    "description": ".223 Remington ammunition with 55gr FMJ-BT bullets, patterned after the M193 loading.  The .223 round has been very popular with civilian shooters for almost a century, finding use in a wide variety of weapons.  The combination of high velocity with a thinly jacketed, cannelured projectile led to unexpected yaw and fragmentation in soft tissue, increasing this round's performance.",

Originally designed for the M249 FN Minimi, M855 was designed to penetrate steel helmets and light cover at range, sacrificing terminal performance and accuracy in the process.  The limited yaw and fragmentation is worsened with shorter barreled carbines shooting this round, and optimization of barrel twist for stabilization of the tracer variant of M855 has resulted in lackluster accuracy overall.",
