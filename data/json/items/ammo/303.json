    "description": "The standard combat cartridge of the British empire throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, first as a bottlenecked black powder design before evolving into a spitzered, smokeless round, this is a modern produced .303 caliber cartridge.  Loaded with a 174gr boat-tailed hollo-point bullet, the projectile’s boat tail shaped design gives it greater stability with less aerial drag over long ranges, making it favorable for competition shooting.  Simultaneously, the bullet’s hollow-point construction leaves behind larger wound channels when used in an offensive role.",

Loaded with a single core, 180gr soft-point bullet, the projectile features an open-tipped design manufactured from soft lead.  This loading allows the round to undergo greater expansion upon striking targets, leading to larger wound channels and greater overall terminal performance.",

Loaded with a single core, 174gr full metal jacketed bullet, the projectile possesses a solid metal jacket that grants it the capability to punch through thicker material.
