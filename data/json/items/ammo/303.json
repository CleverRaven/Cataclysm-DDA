    "description": "Modern manufactured spitzered .303 calibre cartridges, loaded with 174 GR boat-tailed hollo-point bullets.  Starting life as a black powder cartridge in service with British Long Lee rifles in the early nineteenth century, the cartridge evolved into a centre-fired smokeless-powder design and became the standard rifle and machinegun cartridge of the British commonwealth, until it was phased out by 7.62mm NATO.  The round’s boat tail design gives it greater stability with lese aerial drag over long ranges, making it favourable for competition shooting, whilst the bullet’s hollow-point construction leaves behind larger wound channels when used in an offensive roll.",
