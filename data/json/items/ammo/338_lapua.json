Developed as a joint venture between Accuracy International, SAKO, and Lapua, the .338 round is a long-range sniping cartridge that boasts impressive accuracy, devastating terminal ballistics, and an eye-watering price tag to match.  With burgeoning interest amongst military, law enforcement, and civilian circles before the Cataclysm, the .338 cartridge filled the gap between lighter infantry munitions and anti-material rounds, although its potential utility as a hunting cartridge was somewhat diminished due to its high cost.",
