    "description": ".450 Bushmaster ammunition, loaded with a plastic-capped 250-grain Flex Tip bullet.  Born from discontent with the .223 Remington’s weak stopping potential, the .450 Bushmaster round was crafted in line with the so-called 'Thumper' concept: an envisioned need for a large-bore, semi-automatic sporting cartridge capable of downing game in one shot.  Along with its elder sibling, the .50-caliber Beowulf cartridge, the .450 Bushmaster is one of a number of such high-caliber rounds and is compatible with appropriately converted AR-15-platform rifles.  This particular cartridge possesses a plastic-tipped projectile, which acts as an improved hollow point bullet with uniform and devastating expansion within wound cavities.",
