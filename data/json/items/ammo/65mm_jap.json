Excellent against medium game, the 6.5mm Arisaka was the standard combat cartridge of the Japanese empire from 1897 until the end of the Second World War.  Often overlooked before the Cataclysm, largely due to its rarity, and sometimes criticised for lacking sufficient man-stopping potential, the cartridge is nevertheless, for a battle rifle round, soft-recoiling and flat-shooting.",

Sometimes criticised for lacking sufficient man-stopping potential, the cartridge is nevertheless, for a battle rifle round, soft-recoiling and flat-shooting.  Considering the rarity of modern rounds and the prevalence of Arisaka rifles themselves, the 6.5mm Japanese was a popular target among reloaders, and this particular cartridge is the fruit of such labour.  Hand-reloaded by a survivor or a pre-Cataclysm hobbyist, expect slightly inferior performance to factory-produced ammunition.",
