Often overlooked before the Cataclysm, largely due to its rarity, and sometimes criticised for lacking sufficient man-stopping potential, the cartridge is nevertheless, for a battle rifle round, soft-recoiling and flat-shooting.",

Sometimes criticised for lacking sufficient man-stopping potential, the cartridge is nevertheless, for a battle rifle round, soft-recoiling and flat-shooting.  Considering the rarity of modern rounds and the prevalence of Arisaka rifles themselves, the 6.5mm Japanese was a popular target among reloaders, and this particular cartridge is the fruit of such labour.  Hand-reloaded by a survivor or a pre-Cataclysm hobbyist, expect slightly inferior performance to factory-produced ammunition.",
