It can produce electricity for several years at a steady voltage... but it's barely enough to power a small LED, and these batteries were worth hundreds of dollars.  Mostly they're a good way to brag to your neighbours that you have a nuclear power source in your house.",

The CuppaTech 4 radioisotope thermoelectric generator is a three kilogram chunk of metal with a slug of polonium-210 encased within.  It is capable of generating somewhere between 50-60 Watts of thermal energy, although its electrical generation capacity is minimal at only 2 Watts.",
