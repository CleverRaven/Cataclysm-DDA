These resources are checked and updated by FEMA on a regular basis, but if you find some items missing, please contact a FEMA supervisor at your earliest convenience.\n\nPlease wait in the shelter until an official evacuation transport arrives to take you to your homes or, in the event of a major disaster, to the nearest evacuation gathering point.\n\nIn the event that you have been evacuated under violent circumstances, FEMA recommends taking cover in the shelter's basement until help arrives.  Remember: if you leave the shelter, we cannot find you to take you to safety.",
