    "description": "A homemade suppressor made from a pipe and improvised wipe media.  For as long as the wipes hold up, it will reduce the amount of noise and muzzle flash generated by the report of a firearm.  Gunfire is extremely loud and can damage your hearing without protection; a suppressor will bring the loudness of a report down to generally safe levels, as well as slightly reducing recoil and muzzle velocity.  This simple suppressor is large and, when attached, will interfere with your ability to aim down the base sights of the gun.",
