With a tried and proven pedigree dating back over 60 years, millions of such rugged arms have been made, exported, and used throughout the United States and the world at large.  Where hunting is concerned, this is a highly capable and well proven weapon in all respects.  Fortunate, given that your prey in these dark days may turn out to be a little bit more feisty than typical White-Tailed deer, moose, and black bears.",
