    "description": "The most popular gun to use the 85-12mm cartridge was, of course, the PA md. 71.  Its predecessor, the md. 68, was viewed by many as a sort of failure: although it was reliable and powerful, it was too heavy to be used as a good infantry weapon, and not really heavy enough to be a good support gun.  Enough were made, though, that during the zombie apocalypse, it gained a great deal of resurgent popularity as a light emplacement gun that used readily available ammunition.  It perfectly served the purposes of the Exodii, who had far less concern about its unwieldiness.",
