    "description": "The most popular gun to use the 12.3ln cartridge was, of course, the PA md. 71.  Its predecessor, the md. 68, was viewed by many as a sort of failure: although it was reliable and powerful, it was too heavy to be used as a good infantry weapon, and not really heavy enough to be a good support gun.  Enough were made, though, that during the zombie apocalypse, it gained a great deal of resurgent popularity as a light emplacement gun that used readily available ammunition.  It perfectly served the purposes of the Exodii, who had far less concern about its unwieldiness.",

It is well suited to precision shots against high-priority targets.  This modified design fires an extremely rapid 5-shot burst, with the goal of shredding the target and preventing revivification.",
