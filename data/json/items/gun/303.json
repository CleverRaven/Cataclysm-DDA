Chambered for .303 ammunition and assigned with a sword-style bayonet, the rifle makes use of ten-round detachable magazines.  With its full length wooden handguard, brass buttplate, and smooth action, the Lee-Enfield cuts a recognizable profile in either the trenches of the Great War or the zombie-strewn wastelands.",
