    "description": "A lesser known variant of the MAC-10, this machine pistol is chambered in .380 ACP for a smaller overall size while remaining inherently subsonic.  Smaller in almost every dimension, this inexpensive automatic weapon was declared 'fit only for combat in a phone booth' due to its low weight and absurd fire rate ranging from 1200 to 1400 rounds per minute.",
