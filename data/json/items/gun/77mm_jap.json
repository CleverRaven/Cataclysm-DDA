Powerful, dependable, and elegantly built, Japan’s 20th-century infantry rifle may yet find service guarding the lives of her former enemies.",

Though the rifle was historically sneered at in the US due to extensive anti-Japanese propaganda and the lower quality of later-production guns, the weapon is, by most metrics, a finely produced and effective shoulder arm.  This particular Arisaka is an early-war example with anti-aircraft sights and an intact 6-pettle chrysanthemum seal.",

        "description": "The standard sniper’s weapon of Imperial Japan, this rifle is essentially an early production Type 99 Arisaka fitted with an offset optical sight and a bent bolt handle to facilitate stripper clip loading and easy manipulation despite the skope's presence.  While its 7.7x58mm chambering resulted in a muzzle flash and report that were significantly greater than those of the Type 97, which it sought to replace, the rifle’s man-stopping potential is nothing to be trifled with."
