Making use of uniquely designed 50 or 100 round circular magazines, the Calico might not be a particularly good gun, but will throw an overwhelming amount of lead down range for a long time providing that it doesn't choke, jam, and die."

        "description": "A late 19th century semi-automatic German pistol with an integral magazine loaded from the top via stripper clips, and quite possibly the most steampunk gun one could ever possibly lay their hands on.  A red number '9' burned and painted into the weapon's broom handle-shaped grip marks it as a variant chambered for 9x19mm rounds.  Both exported for commercial use and produced for the German military during the First World War to make up for production shortages of the standard Luger, this example likely entered the US as a holdover from the Great War.  You suppose that it's only fitting that one of the globe's first produced and oldest semi-automatic handguns gets reinstated into service now that the planet's facing its end."
