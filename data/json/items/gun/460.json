Because it shares most of its parts with the L39-460, this variant retains the ability to fire fearsome .460 Rowland, though users are strongly advised not to do so during automatic fire.  Comes with built in red dot, recoil compensator and laser sights.  Similar to other Leadworks products it doesn't accept third-party modifications.",
