The primary differences that set this weapon apart from its Marshal sibling are the removal of the MRAD's caliber conversion capabilities and the installation of a fixed buttstock.  These changes have resulted in a lighter and slimmer rifle that, most importantly for the discerning pre-Cataclysmic precision shooter, didn't require a second mortgage to purchase."
