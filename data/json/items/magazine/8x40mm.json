Formed from two conjoined 12-round magazines that feed two stacks of cartridges into a compatible firearm, this downsized magazine proved to be one of the company’s most popular, striking a favourable balance between practical dimensions while also offering a respectable amount of potential firepower.",

For its pleasant balance between compactness and round capacity, this downsized magazine proved to be one of Rivtech’s more popular offerings within civilian spheres, despite the occasional failures to feed that it’s unconventional design prompts.",
