When cycling, the cartridges at the apex of each compartment are shuttled forward, with the front round being delivered into the chamber while its twin replaces its position at the foremost magazine's top.  For its pleasant balance between compactness and round capacity, this downsized magazine proved to be one of Rivtech’s more popular offerings within civilian spheres, despite the occasional failures to feed that it’s unconventional design prompts.",
