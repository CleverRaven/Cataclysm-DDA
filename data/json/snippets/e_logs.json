He was at the office late last night trying to ensure that everything was under control when he was caught in one of the riots that have been happening all over the city.  Despite all the efforts, Rob did not make it.\nRob was more than just a boss to us, he was a friend and a mentor to many of us.  Rob always put the company and its employees first and he will be deeply missed.\nPlease keep Rob’s family and loved ones in your thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.  The company is working closely with the authorities to ensure that Rob’s death is fully investigated.\n\nIn the meantime, all of Rob's responsibilities will be temporarily handled by James Sullivan, his senior assistant.  If you have any urgent matters, please reach out to James.\nWe will provide updates as they become available and further details on arrangements to celebrate Rob's life.\n\nSincerely,\nDahila Nance\nHead of HR department."

The grind of tracks and base-growl of an engine dominate the choppy audio as an Abrams tank rumbles into view, flanked by several squads of armed soldiers running beside the vehicle.  Locked behind the rubber shell of a gas mask, each man carries an automatic rifle, skulking carefully along the sides of the tank as the group proceeds down the road.  As the view pans, a soldier leading the column briefly pauses by a blown-open cellar, the cameraman audibly whispering hurried prayers as the infantryman trains their rifle on the abyss.  The view jerks sharply as a glistening, artery-like appendage writhes from an unseen point, crashing through the soldier’s mask and bursting out the back of their skull before yanking them from the ground.  The desperate liturgies grow louder as the view tilts up and reveals the opposite building’s roof line, thickly coated in a crust of churning cytoplasm and organ-like flesh, and over which the hapless soldier’s body is dragged out of sight, before a waterfall of blood erupts and spurts across the convoy.  As the cameraman whimpers in terror, a nightmarish, spidery amalgamation of flesh and bones clambers over the roof’s edge and plunges into the amassed soldiers.  The scene erupts in a mass of gunfire and frantic screams."

A solitary, desert-drab plane rests upon the stretch of concrete, its boarding stairs lowered, and its twin engines whining as it idles, the drone of its motors almost eclipsing the distant screams and gunfire occasionally conveyed through the crackling audio.  Minutes into the tape, a small group of ragged people burst into view: assorted individuals in civilian garb flanked by a scattering of soldiers, all running headlong towards the aircraft.  A small child can be seen at the rear of the group, half carried by a serviceman and lagging behind the main body.  Suddenly, a violent flutter of gossamer wings fills the view as a dog-sized insectoid lunges past the camera, the colorful wasp alighting on the child’s back and snapping large mandibles about them.  As a sickening, writhing carpet of wasps swarms into view and the group’s front-runners begin to hurry up the aircraft’s steps, a terrible game of tug of war ensues between the soldier and the ever-growing number of frenzied parasitoides, culminating in the man reeling back, showered in spurting blood, and clutching the child’s chewed-off arm.  As the screaming child is subsumed beneath a twitching carapace of legs and pulsating ovipositors and the soldier is forced up the stairs, he pulls a pistol and fires wildly into the swarm, the ammunition depleting before he’s dragged into the aircraft.  The last thing that the camera records is a spherical object being flung from the plane’s closing door—the item pinging off the taxying aircraft’s wing and rolling into the frenzied crowd.  The plane powers out of sight, moments before the footage goes white."

The view is filled by a small group of grinning college-age individuals crowding in a haphazard line before the camera, a network of tents and camping equipment visible in the gloom-shrouded field behind them.\n\n\"Hey Mallick\" chirps a feminine voice as the film pans across the assembly, a handful of whooped salutations accompanying the speaker’s voice.  \"We all heard about you being laid up in the hospital after the scuffle in <city> last week, and we wanted to say that we're actually really missing your broken ass out here in bum fuck nowhere.

An uneasy silence falls across the group as, from an unseen point in the darkness, the chant resounds, growing more distorted and twisted with each inhuman repetition.  A muttered \"What the fuck?\" can be heard as the call continues, seeming to grow louder or closer, now accompanied with the audible crunch of trampled vegetation.  Nervously, a young man draws a 10mm pistol from beneath his jacket and opens his mouth, before a shapeless, pink mass gallops from the gloom behind him on many nimble legs, rapping mauve tendrils about his head as it grips his shoulders with twitching claws, before wrenching its horrific tendrils and ripping the man’s head clean off.\n\n\"GET WELL SOON!\" screams the Mi-go, blood showering from its fleshy, flower-like head before it lunges at the camera."

Maintaining an enthused monolog, the youth’s upbeat commentary plods along for most of the video, undisturbed by intermittent, inhuman screams and distant detonations.  Indeed, even when the sky beyond his window abruptly darkens, the man shows little reaction save for moving to turn on an adjacent lamp, his commentary swiftly resuming despite the device failing to turn on.\n\nMinutes pass, and, following a particularly violent glitch, an amorphous, white shape can be seen suspended in the gloom, some distance beyond the window.  A chain of malfunctions suddenly begins, each glitch rendering the screen dark.  With every glitch, the form grows steadily closer until its visage is suddenly pressed against the glass.  Bearing the shape of a woman, with patches of fish-like scales knitting between jagged rows of protruding teeth that emerge from its skin, the naked aberration grins with a mouth full of slithering tentacles, its eye sockets replaced by gnashing maws, and many dozens of staring eyes sunken into its undulating flesh.  Another malfunction darkens the screen, only for the view to be nearly subsumed by the nightmare’s writhing face when vision returns, the creature’s rotten, bloated body merging straight through the still-babbling man’s trunk.  A final malfunction robs the footage of visuals, and when it returns, only the man can be seen—sitting quietly alone, his bloodied, empty eye sockets staring at the camera, his toothless maw gaping.  The film goes black, and for the final minutes, only the man’s soft crying can be heard."

A yawning chasm splits the ground where a main road had evidently lain; the concrete thoroughfare burst open as though from some tremendous subterranean pressure.  Mottled, gray mold cakes the surroundings, swamping debris, street fixtures, and entire vehicles in layers of fungal matter, giant, mushroom-like stems lifting heavy heads to the roofs of buildings.  A solitary soldier stands atop a half-collapsed roof, quivering mold reaching almost level with the structure’s parapet.

The sickening sound of sawing meat and cracking bones can be heard, all but lost beneath the woman’s agonized screams.  For the last 15 minutes of the recording, only the dripping sound of coils of wet, viscous material dribbling to the ground can be heard."
