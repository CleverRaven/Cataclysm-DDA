If you have some question about safety protocols or shipping procedures, please contact your SRCF administrator or on-site military officer.  When in doubt, assume all containers are Class-A Biohazards and highly toxic.  Take full precautions!"

If your facility currently has these containers stored in close proximity, you are to work with armed guards on duty at all times.  Report any unusual activity to your SRCF administrator at once."

Below is the message that he sent me.\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nSubj: Congressional Investigations\nTo: Constantine Dvorak, Undersecretary of Nuclear Safety\nFrom: Robert Shane, director of the EPA\n\n  The EPA has opposed the Security-Restricted Containment Facility (SRCF) project from its inception.  We were horrified that these facilities would be constructed so close to populated areas, and only agreed to sign-off on the project if we were allowed to freely examine and monitor the sarcophagi.  But that has not happened.  Since then, the DoE has employed any and all means to keep EPA agents from visiting the SRCFs, using military secrecy, emergency powers, and inter-departmental gag orders to surround the project with an impenetrable thicket of red tape."

      "Although our agents have not been allowed inside, our atmospheric testers in nearby communities have detected high levels of toxins and radiation, and we've found dozens of potentially dangerous unidentified compounds in the ground water.  We now have conclusive evidence that the SRCFs are a threat to the public safety.  We are taking these data to state representatives and petitioning for a full Congressional inquiry.  They should be able to force open your secret vaults, and the world will see what you've been hiding.\n\nIf you had any hand in this outbreak I hope you will rot in hell.\n\nDirector of the EPA,\n  Robert Shane"

It is vital that you standby for further orders.  We are currently awaiting the President to decide our course of action in this national crisis.  You will proceed with fail-safe procedures and rig the sarcophagus with C-4 as outlined in Publication 4423.  We will send you orders to either detonate and seal the sarcophagus or remove the charges.  It is of the utmost importance that the facility be sealed immediately when the orders are given.

By direct order, all non-essential staff must vacate at the earliest possible opportunity to prevent potential contamination.  Low yield tactical nuclear demolition charges will be deployed in the lower tunnels to ensure that recovery of hazardous material is impossible.  The Army Corps of Engineers will then dump concrete over the rubble so that we can redeploy the 10th Mountain into the greater Boston area.\n\nCornelius,\nMajor General, U.S. Army\nCommander of the 10th Mountain Division"
