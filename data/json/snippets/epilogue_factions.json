Spurred on by small successes, a number of operations to re-secure facilities met with limited success.  Forced to eventually consolidate to large bases, the Old Guard left these facilities in the hands of the few survivors that remained.  As the years passed, little materialized from the hopes of rebuilding civilization…"

The costly victories brought the warlords abundant territory and slaves but little in the way of stability.  Within weeks, infighting led to civil war as tribes vied for leadership of the faction.  When only one warlord finally secured control, there was nothing left to fight for… just endless cities full of the dead."

It became a mecca for advanced technology, selling off devices and equipment that could no longer be reproduced.  Despite this, Hub-01 was never able to expand sufficiently to renew its own population, nor was it able to unite with any other prosperous community, nor could enough trustworthy mercenaries (or staff) be recruited to replace those who died in its defense.  Hub-01 fell into disrepair and ruin.  After the air processing facility was overtaken by mold, the remaining staff of Hub-01 fled the building and were killed by zombies and bandits.  Melchior's drones - possibly by design - were incapable of maintaining themselves without human hands, and stopped working a few months later.  Without regular maintenance, Melchior's own systems also fell to ruin, and less than a decade after the Cataclysm, humanity's first AI powered down and was forgotten."
