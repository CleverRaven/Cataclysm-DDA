Hub-01 fell into disrepair and ruin.  After the air processing facility was overtaken by mold, the remaining staff of Hub-01 fled the building and were killed by zombies and bandits.  Melchior's drones - possibly by design - were incapable of maintaining themselves without human hands, and stopped working a few months later.
