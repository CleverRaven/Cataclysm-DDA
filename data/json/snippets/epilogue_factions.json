It became a mecca for advanced technology, selling off devices and equipment that could no longer be reproduced.  Despite this, Hub-01 was never able to expand sufficiently to renew its own population, nor was it able to unite with any other prosperous community, nor could enough trustworthy mercenaries (or staff) be recruited to replace those who died in its defense.  Hub-01 fell into disrepair and ruin.  After the air processing facility was overtaken by mold, the remaining staff of Hub-01 fled the building and were killed by zombies and bandits.  Melchior's drones - possibly by design - were incapable of maintaining themselves without human hands, and stopped working a few months later.  Without regular maintenance, Melchior's own systems also fell to ruin, and less than a decade after the Cataclysm, humanity's first AI powered down and was forgotten."
