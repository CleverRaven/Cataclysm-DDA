Civilians will be forced to supply themselves over the next weeks.  Sources indicate this problem is widespread in other major population centers, but aggravated locally by the very high number of bombing targets over the last two days."

No rescue attempts will be funded; it is assumed there are no survivors in the area.  This follows on the heels of the quarantining of large sections of the Midwest last night.  Cellular and land-based communication grids have been blocked by large numbers of people attempting to contact loved ones.  It is recommended that civilians avoid use of these tools for all but the most urgent messages."
