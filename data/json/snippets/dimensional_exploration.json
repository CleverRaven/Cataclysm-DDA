Expedition members reported observing a spheroid-entity ('PE-01') moving beneath the typically opaque t-substrate.  Interference readings and expedition testimony implies the PE-01 was a potent EM radiation source, and the origin of the interference.  After 30 min, PE-01 receded and the expedition was aborted in accordance of procedure EMER-12.  The expedition team suffered no injuries during the incident.\n\nIt's become clear we have greatly underestimated the risk posed by phase immersions.  Engineering has been tasked with designing a new, improved protection suite, and has shown promising advances.  Updated emergency procedures are in-progress.\n\nRefer to file EXO-I-271 for full report."

We have already requested the acquisition of several identical seismographs, for further experimentation."
