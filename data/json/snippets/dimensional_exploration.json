      "\nIMMERSION LOG: 27A\n\nINCIDENT REPORT:\n\nSUMMARY:\nUnforeseen EM interference source forced the team to remain in-phase between prime and sub-scape 27.  Expedition members reported a observing a spheroid-entity ('PE-01') moving beneath the typically opaque t-substrate.  Interference readings and expedition testimony implies the PE-01 was a potent EM radiation source, and the origin of the interference.  After 30min,  PE-01 receded and the expedition was aborted in accordance of procedure EMER-12.  The expedition team suffered no injuries, physical or mental, during the incident. \n\nIts become clear we have greatly underestimated the risk posed by phase immersions.Engineering has be tasked with designing a new, improved protection suite, and has shown promising advances.  Updated emergency procedures are in-progress.\n\n Refer to file EXO-I-271 for full report."

Samples of t-substrate were first recovered during IMMERSION-25A, when upon return to prime the samples violently [////////], exhibiting what are now known as 'plane-uneven' physical properties.  The following report will examine such variances to the best extent of our knowledge.\n\n Refer to file EXO-M-312 for full report."
