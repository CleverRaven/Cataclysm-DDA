With the setting sun’s light reflecting off the surface of a helmet she holds under one arm, she’s casually leaning against a propped-up motorcycle, her head slightly inclined as she shoots a black-glossed grin towards the camera.  In looping handwriting, the back end of the picture is inscribed with the text, \"Dallas, 1993.\"\n\n\"Though cancer has parted us, I’ll always carry you with me.\""

In the distance, a herd of deer can be seen clustered by a semi-frozen lake.  The fact that some of the group's fawns seem to sport unnaturally course streaks of black hair and that, you could swear, at least one of them has a second set of eyes between their budding antlers seems to have gone unnoticed by the photo’s previous owner."

A smiling young man dressed in an olive-drab flight suit stands in the foreground, framed by the open doorway of an UH-1 Huey helicopter, a gloved hand gripping the door, a flight helmet and pushed-up aviator’s goggles perched upon his head, and a jaunty thumbs-up directed towards the camera.  In shaky handwriting, the back of the picture is marked with the caption, \"September 10th, 1967.\"\n\nIn smaller script, someone’s written, \"still missing in action. May you fly on in our hearts.\""

Judging by the way that they’re clinging to one another, the spaced-out grins all around, and the presence of more than a few licker bottles brandished like the holy grail, the assembly’s probably halfway to being drunkenly sprawled on the floor.  The picture’s edges have been blurred and messily cropped out in post, likely in an effort to hide the mountain range of \"sugar\" proudly rising from tables in the background.  It's just a shame that it only resulted in a worse photo."

The barrel of a big-game hunting rifle rests upon the barrier’s lip, the weapon gripped by an affectionately grinning man sitting beside the child.  Helpfully holding the gun steady as the youth gazes through the sights, one of the man’s palms is lightly resting upon the girl’s hand as he shows her how to work the weapon’s bolt.  You don’t know their names, but you’re likely the only person who’ll ever recall their faces."

His arms are clasped around a fluffy ball of brown fuzz, which, initially, you mistake for a plushie before the bright eyes, lolling tongue, and madly wagging tail place it as a majestically furry canine.  A breed you’ve never seen before: the dog’s pictured with its front paws awkwardly gripping the child’s shoulders as it happily laps at his face.  Its paws look like tiny, clawed hands."
