      "A sac connected to the sting is filled with some fluid.  Might it perhaps have some useful properties?",

      "At the top of the creature you find what you assume is a brain, although it seems to employ quadrilateral symmetry and thus is shaped and organized completely differently from that of terrestial versions."
