      "Thick fibers are found throughout the body of the creature.  Perhaps they serve a scaffolding purpose similar to that of (very flexible) bones.",

      "A sac connected to the sting is filled with some fluid.  Might it perhaps have some useful properties?",
      "While the roots of the plant creature contain muscles and veins, they also contain finer networks indicating a use for nutrient uptake when the roots are lodged into the soil.",
      "At the top of the creature you find what you assume is a brain, although it seems to employ quadrilateral symmetry and thus is shaped and organized completely differently from that of terrestrial versions."
