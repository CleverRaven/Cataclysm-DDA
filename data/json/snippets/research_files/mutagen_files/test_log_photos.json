Speckled with dried blood and scratch marks, blisters pockmark the expanse, though, from some, strands of bluish grey fuzz emanate.

A line of bristle-like feathers has ripped through the eyebrow, with deposits of dried blood flakes, hair, and scraps of skin speckling the eyelid.  Beside the lid, starting from the eye’s leftward corner, three perpendicular red trenches gouge the skin, scoring bloody, cartilage-littered lines through the feathers and winding through darkened, waterlogged flesh."
