My loving parents, grandparents, and even children had to pass on and yet their flesh still roam the earth.  May Allah bless me with eternal sleep.  Never forget, Ayaan, what made you, YOU.  That all creation is Mind, and every effect a mental phenomena."

If I am going to die a sinner, I may as well take as many horrors with me and go down hell a legend.  Those post-apocalyptic poets better sing of me!  I am Johann de Winsdal, remember that."
