Cutting damage is a fixed amount, but is blocked by armor.  The To-hit bonus affects your chances of hitting.

Recoil severely reduces your chance to hit, but you can eliminate recoil by pausing ('.') for a turn or moving normally.  High strength reduces recoil, so weak characters might want to stick to .22 or 9x19mm guns."
