Gentle wind with drizzling rain, I thought I died and this was heaven.\nI must've spent hours just going through those replicas of my cabin, every single one was the same \na bench on the porch, windows \nI think there's something special about this configuration \nsomething special about the layout of my cabin \nit can't be a coincidence \nI can't tell how many hours passed when I was whisked back home, the sky was normal again \nI wish to go back \nall I want to do is to get back there \nit wasn't a dream "
