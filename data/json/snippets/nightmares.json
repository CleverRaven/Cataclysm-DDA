      "You awaken from a nightmare about being eaten alive while your friends applaud.",
      "You awaken from a nightmare about being naked in an arctic tundra and freezing to death.",
      "You awaken from a nightmare about an unseen predator slowly killing you.",
      "You awaken from a nightmare about killing those you love with your bare hands.",
      "You awaken from a nightmare about being finally judged for your ill deeds.",
      "You awaken from a nightmare about the cataclysm not having happened and being stuck in an office job.",
      "You awaken from a nightmare about the cataclysm being all in your head,  all those innocents you've murdered.",
      "You awaken in a cold sweat, relieved that you weren't being eaten alive by evil twinkies.",
      "You awaken feeling hollow; you dreamt of your friends and family, only to realize your new reality is the nightmare.",
      "You abruptly awake, relief washes over you as you were no longer naked, and the zombies were no longer laughing at you."
