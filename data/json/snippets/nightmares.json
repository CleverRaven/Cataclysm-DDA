    "//": "When writing nightmares, take care to (1) ensure they are generic enough that getting the same nightmare twice in a row isn't too weird, and (2) that they don't assume anything about the person having them.  If your nightmare reads like a horror story or creepypasta, it is probably going too far. In general, avoid too much description.",
    "//2": "It's also a good idea to try mainly to include nightmares that have something to do with the apocalyptic setting of the game, not just generic scary dreams.  Obviously, not all nightmares have to follow this rule, but the more they advance the overall setting of DDA the better.",

Underfoot, splintered shards of asphalt slice at your bare soles, your steps growing more sodden and sticky as each tread peals flesh and blood froths.  however, it is nothing to the raw, throbbing agony at your abdomen, the skin of your belly hanging open like a jacket's lapels, pale coils of intestine spilling forth.  Between your clenched fists, a stretch of gut hangs from the opening, its end leading into the mist ahead like a guiding thread.\n\nShuffling along, a flicker of recognition whispers at the back of your mind as you hobble between the hulks of recked vehicles that loom in the fog to either side, your guiding line occasionally requiring you to collapse upon hands and knees and crawl under a car.  Following the last such obstacle, as you rise, your shredded foot slides from beneath you, sending you collapsing — the gathered bundle of organs you'd managed to stuff back within yourself cascading forth.  As your cheeks grow damp, you look up from the mess of splintered roadwork and throbbing guts — up — at the sprawling bulk of a collapsed homestead that rises from the fog before you.\n\nThrough the mist, you can see the pallid coils that compose the structure and the shuffling, anthropomorphic figures wandering within, glistening wetly.  As you watch, one of the humanoids wobbles from a sagging aperture and stands, its oblong head (composed of layers of coiled strands) turning to face you.  Under your prone body, your intestines pulsate.  The facsimile of your form pulses in unison.  The copy of your home pulses in unison.\n\nYou scream."

A low, thrumming cadence drones in your ears, vibrating through the steel underfoot — the humming of some monstrous, unseen motor at work powering the mechanism that stretches before you.  Trundling from an aperture at the room's right and grinding past, a massive conveyor belt groans along; it's rubber tread Layden with a row of neatly placed bodies.  As they're born along, you find yourself recognising pallid faces, staring eyes, gaping maws, and bruised flesh forming facsimiles of people you'd encountered during the last days of evacuation: refugees, soldiers, and relief workers.\n\nAs the corpses reach the end of the line and are unceremoniously dumped upon the floor, their limbs contort, cracking noises punctuating the air over the grinding of the belt as they start to flail and wriggle across the steel, worming towards you.  Writhing and slithering across one another, they crawl in a loop about you, your stomach churning as the sounds of stretching flesh fill your ears as their necks stretch forth, lifting their heads level with your own.  As growing numbers of blood-shot eyes fixate upon you and a forest of extending necks cocoons you, each head jabbers out a singular, unique word: a discordant muddle of phrases that grows more coherent with each body that joins the assembly.\n\n\"We are all you escaped; you left us.

As you wade through a growing mire of claustrophobia, you register that someone's got a solid hold of your ankles, hauling you like a sack of potatoes.  In a stomach-lurching moment, you feel yourself being lifted and heaved through the air, the grip on your legs disappearing as you plummet, crashing upon a partially soft, uneven platform undulating against your spine.\n\nAs you collect your faculties, you spy a slight tare in the plastic, and, greedy for a breath of air and a peep of vision, you press your face against the slit.  The blue expanse of the sky winks down upon you, rimmed by the dirt inclines of a pit, as, teaming about the edges, gasmask-wearing soldiers haul, kick, and shove plastic-swaddled bundles into the ditch.  As the body bags land heavily upon and about your form, you can feel their reanimating contents struggling against their captivity.\n\nSeparated from the zombies about you by only a few layers of plastic, all you can do is futilely kick and cry for help as the last bags are piled into the ditch atop you, fingers clawing at the material at your back.  Overhead, the soldiers withdraw, save for a handful who set about upturning a collection of jerrycans into the trench.  As the overpowering smell of gasoline fills your nostrils, you whimper.\n\nMoments before the undead below you rend your plastic barrier, your eyes are blinded as a burning flare is flung into the corpse pit, the light descending like a falling star."

Staring ahead yields the dishevelled vista of a bus's interior, the stench of Greece, and body odour clawing at your nostrils.  Bedraggled, hunched, with faces creased by fear, people huddle within every seat abord, each perfectly silent and, to a passenger, staring ahead at the vehicle's tinted windscreen.  As the infantile crying continues unabated, you glance out of your own window.\n\nYou vainly try to convince yourself that the fleshy, metre-tall thing your eyes land upon beyond the glass, half stalking and half slithering towards the bus, couldn't have once been human.  Nothing with an internal skeleton should be able to wriggle its entire head in such a manner or slouch across the ground as though walking on rubberized legs.\n\nRegardless, as the aberrant monstrosity draws nearer, it becomes evident that the creature's march towards the transport isn't guided by its eyes: berried within floppy slits exuding a green mucus.  Rather, the way its squid-like head twists and turns as it walks, pauses, and then reassumes its stride could only signal the alure of sound — the wailing.  Yet, your attention's suddenly diverted by the plastic creek of the bus's aisleway as, turning, you find a soldier stomping past, making a B-line aft, towards the infant's increasingly animal-like screams.\n\nEveryone aboard mutely cowers as the military man storms down the passage.  The hard look on his face and the glint of a drawn bayonet don't escape your notice before you follow your compatriots' example.\n\nA few, terrible seconds later, your dream lapses into wakefulness: cut, as though by a blade through tender flesh."

Wakefulness crashes upon you when you glance at yourself, only to find an oozing mass writhing before your eyes.",

Your feeble protestations fall on deaf ears.  These protests crash to a halt as soon as the officer turns to face you.  The thing occupying your officer's skin wishes you a \"good morning\" and mildly suggests failing yourself as well, if you don't want to see it again.",

Clustered atop your palm, you spy a group of tiny soldiers huddling from a massive swarm of zombies that flood about your feet, gnawing bloody routs through your flesh.  Before the pain grows too much to bear, you look down at the soldiers, only to find myriad copies of your own face staring back up at you in fear.",
      "You have a dream about stumbling through a rundown facility, an old military base, with lights flashing red and alarms deafening.  You're trying to hide from something — a glowing red, humanoid outline that stalks the halls and fazes through fractal patterns in the walls.  Your bullets do nothing against it.  Your running never takes you far enough.  Even hiding, eventually, doesn't work.",
      "In your dreams, you're standing in line for a briefing supervised by your unit's superior officer, but every time the CO opens their mouth, all you can hear is a rising, fog-horn-like shrieking that only gets louder.  You try to cover your ears.  You try leaving the room.  The sound follows you.  As you stumble into wakefulness, you know there was something else.  You'd tried to silence the awful sound, but the recollection slips out of your grasp."

E.g., having the player in the body of a zombie as they get gunned down by soldiers is fine, but having a dream about falling from an aeroplane into water infested by clowns isn't suitable for this category.",

      "In your dreams, you wander the refugee centre's halls, alone.  The building looks as though the weight of years has born down upon it, the structure's dilapidated, and everywhere is overgrown by a greenish grey coating of mycelium.  By the dream's end, you can't count how many human-long bones you've found woven into the mildew-carpeted walls.",
      "Your eyes fly open as the sounds of battle crash across your ears — screams, gunfire — the centre's under attack, though by who or what, you don't know.  Racing through the corridors, all you find are wound-riddled bodies, gouts of blood flowing like rivers, and bullet holes chewing through the walls.  You round a bend, and suddenly:\n\n\"BLAM\"\n\nYou startle awake, your hands flying to your face.  It takes you moments to assure yourself that your skull's free of an extra hole.",
      "In your sleep, you scrabble through the refugee centre, a harsh buzzing in your ears.  Where every human is supposed to be, a giant, vaguely anthropoid insect looms, clacking at you with pincers and oozing mandibles.  You stagger into the lobby, only to find a man-sized, writhing wasp occupying Smokes' nook and piles of eggs deposited on the benches.  Moments before you jolt awake, the wasp bursts through the window.\n\n\"We could do with some food,\" it chitters.",
      "You have a dream about covertly creeping through the evacuation centre, the floors littered with the refugees' sprawled bodies and shadows etching doorways in black.  Echoing through the building, you can hear something's heavy, metallic footfalls: prowling, searching, hunting you.  You awake in a cold sweat moments after rounding a bend and finding a set of opalescent, camera-like eyes meeting your own from a very, very great height.",
      "In your dreams, you walk down the refugee centre's basement stairs, the knowledge that you've been granted a permanent, safe bunk lightening both heart and step.  This relief, however, is short-lived: dispelled as you hear the access stair's door thump shut behind you.  This, however, isn't nearly as worrying as the myriad, maddened snarls that echo from the darkness below.",
      "You open your eyes and find yourself within one of the refugee centre's backrooms — to your surprise, there's a wedding in swing.  Pushing through the crowd, you attempt to gain a look at the newlyweds.  You startle awake as soon as you find two decaying, demonically twisted countenances staring back at you, their mutated tongues fused together and teeth gnashing at one another's bloody skulls.",
      "In your dreams, you sit in the centre's front lobby: destitute, hungry, a begger.  Days of monotony wined past, the stench of filth claws at your nostrils, the scraps your allotted do nothing to sate your hunger — everyday you're mocked like an animal in a zoo as you plead for food and watch those about you grow fat on plenty.",
      "You have a dream about franticly digging long trench lines before the refugee centre, elbow to elbow with the building's denizens, as increasing waves of the dead funnel down the access road.  The zombies crash upon your makeshift battlements as though it's the First World War, and bayonets, bullets, and your own shovel do little to stop the onslaught.",
      "Black, gel-like fluid comes up to your waste as you stumble down the refugee's basement stairs and splash into the underground level, amorphous shapes bobbing in the liquid around you.  Wandering aimlessly through the space, you wade through the chest-high sludge and approach the bundles, only to find that they're all drowned corpses.  At the dream's end, you're surrounded by a wall of bodies floating at eye level, and you realise… the waterline's been rising.  It doesn't stop.",
      "You have a dream about being a loaf of stale, plastic-wrapped bread sitting in languid purgatory within a dark cupboard.  Instinctively, you know that the food's run out within the refugee centre, and, as you hear footfalls rapidly approaching, you brace yourself.  You regret the fact that you have no mouth with which to screen as the door is yanked open and multiple sets of filthy, withered hands descend on you."

      "As the voice of slumber whispers at your mind, you feel like a forsaken soul lost in a sea of fatigue.  You know the sharks of nightmares are circling.",
      "You sway listlessly, your head drooping.  Dejectedly, you wonder at which point the pains of fatigue will outweigh the terror of sleep.",
      "As your shoulders slump below the weight of the day's exertions, you recall your nightmares and try convincing yourself that they're not as bad as you make them to be.  The mere process of recollection sends butterflies gnawing at your guts.",
      "Pinching the bridge of your nose as you rub your eyes, you wish that you could rub away the leftover recollections of your last nightmare from your mind.  Only sleep will replace it.  You're not looking forward to seeing what it replaces it with."
