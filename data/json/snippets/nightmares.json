      "You awaken feeling hollow; you dreamt of your friends and family, only to realize your new reality is the nightmare.",
      "You abruptly awake, relief washes over you as you were no longer naked in the street, and the zombies weren't laughing at you.",
      "You feel something gently embrace you as you sleep.  You open your eyes, but it's too dark to see, you struggle to move, but it has your arms and legs in a cocoon of darkness, it has stolen your mouth and you cannot scream.  It starts to devour you whole, starting with your feet, unable to escape, and unable to scream.  You take your last breaths.  It was just a dream.",
      "You are in a meadow, unsure of how you got here.  The sun is shining, the birds are singing, and children are playing; all is peaceful.  So why do the hairs on your neck stand at attention?  Something is not quite right about this peace.  You turn around, and the children have you surrounded.  The faces of the children have vanished, replaced by a shark-like grin and beady black eyes.  They reach out with their pale, claw-like hands.  However, you cannot move, you cannot escape…",
      "You open your eyes, and you are not where you slept.  You have been strapped to a chair in a dimly lit room with damp, rusty walls.  A clown covered in blood splatters approaches you from behind, wielding a rusty drill, dancing around you until he meets you face to face.  He toys with the trigger, enjoying the sound.  You plead for him to let you go, he replies with this maniacal laugh.  He inches the roaring drill towards your face, playing with you, for you are his toy.  You can't help but to watch in horror as the drill bit slowly inches its way towards your eye, unable to look away and unable to close your eyes.  This is it.",
      "You regain consciousness and realize you are at the bottom of a deep pit.  You can make out a bucket just opposite of you.  Within the bucket you find a bottle of lotion.",
      "You feel as if you are being watched.  Several feet away from you are a pair of burning yellow eyes.  A long, slimy appendage snakes its way towards you, hauling you towards an abyssal pit of serrated teeth.",
      "You try to get comfortable.  You hear a loud skittering sound but see nothing.  The sound grows louder, and yet you see nothing.  Desperate, you search for the source of the sound, you find nothing except for an itch in your ear.  You reach to scratch it, causing hundreds of tiny spiders burst out, you find the source of the sound.",
      "You open your eyes to a blinding light, surrounded by medical equipment, and a group of panicking individuals dressed in blue scrubs.  They seem to be doctors.  Your vision is blurry from the anesthesia, but one of them seems to be holding a mass of flesh; it appears to be alive.  You glance down and find your chest has been cut open.  The doctors start screaming as the mass of flesh rips them apart.  You are next…",

      "You awaken from a nightmare about the Cataclysm not having happened and being stuck in an office job.",
      "You're outside in a park, under a dark gray sky.  The air is thick, and smells like earth.  You hear thunder crack above you, and it begins to rain.  As you look up, you realize with horror that it's raining spiders.  The creatures land all over your body, and you try to cover your mouth and nose but a few manage to slip through your hands.  You can feel the spiders inside your lungs.  You try to scream, but your mouth is full of them.  Tears stream down your face as you choke on millions of tiny black spiders.  You wake up gasping for air.",
      "It's your first day at work!  Unfortunately, the bus had to take a three-hour detour, so you show up extremely late.  As you walk into the office, you suddenly realize you forgot to put your pants on.  Even worse, your mother walks in behind you and starts berating you in front of all your co-workers.  As the entire office laughs at you, you wake up from your nightmare.",
      "You dream of running in an endless hallway.  You hear something gargantuan chasing you with heavy breaths and wet squelching sounds.  You run until you are out of breath and wake up feeling exhausted.",
      "You awaken from a nightmare about drowning in a pit of maggots - chewing and biting your skin, filling your lungs.",
      "In your dream, you are tied to a chair.  You hear a deep voice slowly recite what torments await sinners in hell as you are slowly lowered into a dark pit.  As your vision fades, a large metal hatch closes you into the darkness.",
      "You dream of flying.  You fly higher and higher until you are in outer space.  You look back at Earth and see that it's cracked - something is hatching and a thousand crimson eyes are fixated on you."
