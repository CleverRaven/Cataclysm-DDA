Our chemical department has made great strides in the production of a
concentrated mutagen, derived from samples of mutated individuals.  This
substance has been denoted PE012.
%
Our chemical department has perfected an untargeted stem cell treatment.
Consumption of the treatment will reverse the effects of mutation, and may
even cure congenital defects.  This substance has been denoted PE018.
%
Both PE012 and PE018 show great stability.  A subject was exposed to both
substances, alternating between the mutagen and the purifier.  Ultimately, the
subject returned to baseline state with no apparent side effects.
%
We have made a fascinating discovery; by creating a miniature portal with low
stability and high power, one can transpose into the 4th dimension and return
immediately, but shifted by several meters.  Our subjects oscillated so
quickly that none were even aware that they had visited lower planes.
%
Our research on teleportation has ground to a halt.  For some reason, the
creation of a long-range transportation device eludes us, and one can transfer
no further than 30 meters.
%
I don't know how it happened, but a janitor managed to activate the portal
while cleaning the lab, shifting in an assortment of prehistoric fauna.
Security was called in immediately but was unable to save the janitor from
being torn apart.  By the time the confusion settled, all the fauna had been
terminated.
%
Tests on the prehistoric fauna show extremely close genetic relationships with
extant and extinct terranian animals.  It might be that the portal had performed
a transposition in time, unfortunately the portal device was destroyed when 
security put down the fauna.
%
An incident occurred in the teleportation lab, wherein a subject managed to
teleport into another subject.  The latter was completely destroyed from the
inside out, while the former sustained little damage.  I would like to explore
the phenomenon further, but subjects are expensive.
%
Test subjects in the teleportation department are showing alarming symptoms.
It seems prolonged rapid transposition along the 4th dimension weakens the
forces holding one on this plane.
%
Catastrophe struck in our teleportation department yesterday.  It seems that
our test subjects are so detached from this plane that they create occasional
tunnels along the 4th dimension, allowing life forms to transfer to this
plane.  All subjects with prolonged exposure have been terminated.
%
Our lifeform extraction program continues to produce samples of specimen
XE037.  It seems to be a kind of living, semi-sentient primordial ooze, and is
the basis of much of the life we have found.
%
Specimen XE037, jokingly referred to as "the blob", has been observed entering
a kind of dormant state, forming a depression in the floor.  Hendelson stepped
into one of these pits yesterday, and was immediately coated and attacked.
%
XE037 shows promise as a catalyst for both cloning and treatments that mimic
stem cells.  This is further evidence supporting Hendelson's theory of a near
universal symbiotic relationship involving XE037.
%
Several of the more advanced specimens we have retrieved show stunning
similarity to XE037.  XE142 and XE157 in particular show the same amorphous,
slime-like structure as XE037, suggesting a close genetic relationship.
%
Today we tested weaponry against XE142 and XE157, two amorphous subprime
samples.  Their form proved to be nearly invulnerable to projectile based
weaponry, but they were susceptible to directed energy weapons and flagration.
%
Our cloning department has failed to produce results.  In vats containing stem
cell treatments, XE037, and control vats, the subjects simple disintegrated.
This suggests that XE037, while compatible with subprime lifeforms, shows only
destructive effects on prime plane lifeforms.
%
The vivisection program has shown mixed results, revealing an incredible
degree of variation in subplane lifeforms.  Certain specimens have an internal
structure that is amazingly similar to that of mammals, while others seem to
have no internal structure at all.
%
Our security department has identified several key flaws.  Though our surface
entrance is quite secure, there are several possible points of entry below
the surface, particularly in the sewage systems.
%
Today we applied a very small sample of XE037, suspended in water, to subject
TP92, prior to necessary termination.  During the postmortem examination, the
subject went through a revivification progress, but displayed next to no human
intelligence.
%
Mendelson shows a dismaying lack of organization and security consciousness.
Containment of all samples of XE037 is of critical importance, as shown by
contamination experiments.
%
Mendelson has been terminated following an incident with XE037.  A substantial
mobile sample departed his lab and encountered our security forces.  Before
the sample was destroyed, it managed to kill two men.  Alarmingly, their
corpses displayed mobility and extreme aggression.
%
We have created a new department to investigate the effects of XE037 on the
human body, specifically to examine the revivification effect observed on two
prior occasions.  Sadly, our human subject pool is dwindling due to the short
lifespan of subjects in this program.  More will be acquired soon.
%
Testing XE037 on non-human mammal subjects does not appear to display the same
revivifying effect, oddly enough.  Acquiring non-human subjects, sadly, is a
long and costly process, and research into this area is lacking.
%
After our curious results with testing XE037 on non-human mammals, we decided
to introduce the substance to some of the insects which have found their way
into the lab.  Horrifyingly, XE037 caused near-instant mutation and gigantism
in the insects, and security intervention was required.
%
Program S37ZBE, investigation of XE037 on inert human bodies, is making great
strides.  Recently we found that XE037 has no effect when introduced to a
deceased body; revivification only occurs when the subject is exposed to XE037
prior to expiration.
%
S37ZBE, the special investigation into the effects of XE037 on inert human
bodies, has made terrific discoveries.  It seems that it occasionally displays
a mutagenic property which manifests itself after termination of the subject,
resulting in a striking variety in postmortem morphology.
%
S37ZBE may be put on indefinite hold shortly.  Postmortem morphological
changes have reached extreme levels; this morning one subject nearly doubled
in size, acquiring enough strength to reduce a concrete wall to rubble.  It
required a 6 man team, heavily armed, to re-terminate the subject.
%
Jakobson insists that S37ZBE must continue, despite the extreme security and
safety risks.  Nearly half of our security forces have been redirected to the
S37ZBE project, simply to deal with the occasional escape of a subject.
%
Jakobson was killed today by one of S37ZBE's subjects; ironic considering how
hard he fought to keep the project active.  Alarmingly, his corpse revivified
immediately.  This suggests that XE037 may have contaminated the lab at large.
%
Termination of a subject which was never a part of S37ZBE has confirmed my
fears.  XE037 has contaminated most, if not all of the laboratory, most 
likely via the water supply.  Research has started immediately into a process 
to destroy XE037 within the human body.
%
Despite a wide variety of treatments, we have been completely unsuccessful in
removing XE037 from human subjects.  Every individual displayed revivification
post termination.  Interestingly, XE037 seems to be completely inert prior to
termination.
%
We have finally found success in S37BEP, our emergency investigation into the
destruction of XE037 in living subjects.  8 of 10 of the subjects showed no
revivification, despite confirmed dosages of XE037.
%
PE062, our "cure" for XE037 contamination, has neared perfection.  Sadly, the
production of PE062 is a costly and time-consuming process.  What is more, the
substance shows no effect on postmortem subjects whatsoever; a substance which
renders XE037 inert after it has activated would be immensely useful in the
case of an outbreak.
%
An alarming discovery has been made.  A colony of XE037 has formed nearly a
half mile from the laboratory.  It is unclear how it escaped; it is quite
possible that it is in the ground water now.
%
An emergency meeting was held today to discuss the possible implications of
widespread XE037 contamination.  It was agreed that neutralization must be
instated immediately to prevent a catastrophic event.
%
It has begun.  The XE037 contamination has spread for miles, and those who
have since deceased have revivified.  It is my fear that extremely large
populations will be decimated by this pandemic.  We must find a way to remove
XE037 from revivified bodies.
%
We have even more distressing news than the widespread XE037 contamination, 
there are reports of the XE037 mutating into various new variants. See 
data files on XE037a - XE037f. Research on the effects of these variants
is ongoing. We do know that XE037d shows signs of PE062 immunity, and 
XE037b can revive various breeds of canines. However, revival is not 
as guaranteed as standard XE037 humanoid infection. Canine body size seems 
to influence the chances. See experiment tXE037b_c.
%
Today we found our solution, quite by accident.  It was found that XE037 is
completely removed from a revivified body following a series of extremely-high
energy 4th dimensional transpositions.  Unfortunately, this invariably allows
subplane life forms to pass into the prime plan.  The cure is worse than the
disease.
