Rather than exploring an underground dungeon, with a limited area on each level, you are exploring a truly infinite world, stretching in all four cardinal directions.  In this survival roguelike, you will have to find food; you also need to keep yourself hydrated and sleep periodically.  It's based on principle of realism, so expect all hardships you'd expect in life in a survival situation, and at least a dozen more from the eldritch and sci-fi nature of the Cataclysm itself.",
      "While Cataclysm has more tasks to keep track of than many other roguelikes, the near-future setting of the game makes some tasks easier. Firearms, medications, and a wide variety of tools are all available to help you survive."

Initially keep the guns as a last resort trump card. Ammo is scarce, while zombies are plenty, and unwanted attention may be more you can handle.",
      "It's also important to carry a few medications; painkillers are a must-have, and drugs such as cigarettes will make your life easier (but beware of addiction).  Leave the city as soon as you have a good stockpile of equipment.  The high concentration of zombies makes them a deathtrap - but a necessary resource of food and ammunition.",
      "Avoid combat whenever you can.  Run if you have to, but control your stamina, as zombies are inexhaustible unlike yourself.  Combat is always risky, and sometimes one wrong step may be your last.  Therefore in most cases you gain nothing from combat, unless you are equipped for it and killing zombies will help you achieve something.",
      "Combat is much easier if you can fight just one monster at once.  You can sometimes kite singled-out zombies.  Use doorways as a choke point or stand behind a window and strike as the zombies slowly climb through. Be wary - in number they will push through anyway.  Never be afraid to just run if you can outpace your enemies. Irregular terrain, like forests, may help you lose monsters.",
      "Using firearms is the easiest way to kill an enemy, but the sound will attract unwanted attention.  Save the guns for emergencies, and melee when you can.",
      "If you need to protect yourself from acid, clothing made of cloth < leather < Kevlar < plastic.  So while leather and Kevlar will protect you from active enemies, a hazmat suit and rubber boots will make you nigh-immune to acid damage.  Items made of glass, ceramics, diamond or precious metals will be totally immune to acid.",
      "When looting try to fill your inventory as much as possible without being overloaded.  You never know when you might need an item, most are good to sell, and you can easily drop unwanted items on the floor.  But don't go looting empty-handed, you never know what might happen, so have your most crucial survival items with you.",
      "Keep an eye on the weather.  Wind and humidity will exacerbate dire conditions, so seek shelter if you're unable to withstand them.  Staying dry is important, especially if conditions are so low that they would cause frostbite.  Use a towel to dry yourself if you are wet from the rain.  If you're having trouble staying warm over night, make a pile of clothing on the floor to sleep on.  Finding a pillow and a blanket for your bed is always good for the quality of your sleep.  If you can't have those, improvise, even a chair in a basement is better then a wet ground in the field.  Finding or making a shelter with a place to sleep is very important to your survival.",
      "Winter is harsh. Liquids and food may freeze, and you may need to defrost them using cooking appliance.  Placing them by the lit fire might also help.  Basements are warmer in winter and cooler in summer, so its a good place to place your excess food. Most food decays with time, and that process can be speed up or slowed down by temperature.  Frozen food will not rot.  It you will be able to bring a freezer or a fridge back to life it will help you in the long run.  If those are out of your reach think about constructing root cellar.",
      "You may preserve food in many other ways, for example by using a smoking rack, or using it in a meal that has a longer shelf life."

Once you are in control, <press_UP> accelerates, <press_DOWN> slows or reverses, & <press_LEFT> & <press_RIGHT> turn left or right.  Diagonals adjust course and speed.  You default to cruise control, so the gas/brake adjust the speed which the vehicle will attempt to maintain.",
      "10-30 MPH, or 16-48 KPH, is a good speed for beginning drivers, who tend to fumble the controls.  As your Driving skill improves, you will fumble less and less.  To simply maintain course and speed, hit <press_pause>.",
      "It's a good idea to pull the handbrake - \"s\" - when parking, just to be safe.  If you want to get out, hit the lights, toggle cruise control, turn the engine on or off, or otherwise use the vehicle controls, press <press_control_vehicle> to bring up the \"Vehicle Controls\" menu, which has options for things you'd do from the driver's seat.",
      "Examining (<press_examine>) a vehicle brings up the vehicle interaction window.  The left pane shows a top-down view of your vehicle and each part of it.  The middle pane shows a summary of the vehicle's engines, batteries, storage tanks, weapons, and seating.  The right panel is context sensitive, but normally has descriptions of the vehicle parts in the tile highlighted in the vehicle view on the left.",
      "Across the bottom are a summary of the most important parameters of your vehicle.  Safe speed is how fast you can drive without damaging the engine and maximum speed is how fast you can drive at the engine's maximum output.  Acceleration is how fast your vehicle can increase speed each turn.  Cargo volume is how much cargo you can store and how much stuff you have in your vehicle, mass is how much the vehicle weighs, and the Status and Wheels give a summary of the vehicle condition and wheel condition.  There are also fuel indicators on the lower right that give an estimate of how quickly your fuel will run out.",
      "Air drag, water drag, rolling drag, and static drag are all values that influence your vehicle's safe and maximum speed.  The interaction of drag and engine power is complicated, but generally speaking, more powerful engines will make your vehicle go faster but also consume fuel faster.",
      "Air drag increases as your vehicle gets wider or has more parts that increase the vehicle's height like full boards, aisles, or turrets.  It also increases as the vehicle has a less aerodynamic profile, such as having exposed passengers or full boards at the front of the vehicle.  Air drag strongly influences vehicle speed, especially at high speeds.",
      "Rolling drag increases with vehicle weight and wheel count.  Rigid wheels have less rolling drag per wheel than inflatable wheels, but weigh more so rolling drag may still increase when moving from inflatable wheels to rigid wheels.  Tank treads have enormous rolling resistance and are very heavy, so tanks have a lot of rolling resistance.  Rolling drag influences vehicle speed, but less than air drag does, especially at high speeds.",
      "Vehicles that can move in water have a water drag.  Water drag increases with vehicle width and draft, and draft increases with vehicle weight but is reduced by adding more boat boards and by widening or lengthening the vehicle.  Water drag has enormous effect on vehicle speed in the water.  See the section on water vehicles for more about draft and water drag.",
      "Static drag includes things like plows, and directly reduces your vehicle's acceleration and top speed.",
      "Offroad is a rough estimate of how efficient your vehicle moves when not on pavement.  Your vehicle's safe speed, top speed, and acceleration are multiplied by roughly the off-road percent when your vehicle is not on pavement.  Off-road percentage decreases as vehicle mass increases and increases with the size and number of wheels.  Tank treads will give your vehicle an excellent off-road percentage but your vehicle will be slower due to the treads' very large rolling drag.",
      "Skilled survivors can use wrenches, hacksaws, and welding tools to add or remove parts for a vehicle.  You can even create a vehicle from scratch, by using the Construction (<press_construction>) menu to 'Start a New Vehicle' when they have a frame available.  Tuning a vehicle for speed, fuel consumption, off-road capacity, protection against threats, and cargo capacity is a complicated process.",
      "BOATS AND AMPHIBIOUS VEHICLES",
      "You can use boat hull parts to create boats or amphibious vehicles that can move between water and land.",
      "Each boat hull you add to your vehicle increases the height the vehicle's watertight hull.  If the height of the watertight hull is less than the vehicle's draft, then water will flow into your vehicle and it will sink and be destroyed if it goes into deep water.  If your vehicle's draft is less than the height of the watertight hull, your vehicle will not take on water and will not sink in deep water.",
      "Draft is determined by length and width of your vehicle, the mass of your vehicle, and the percentage of the vehicle's underbody covered in boat hulls.  In general, a vehicle should be able to float if it's mass in tons is less than a quarter of the value of its length and width.  A boat that is 5 tiles wide and 9 tiles long has a good chance of floating if all of its underbody is covered in boat boards and it weighs less than 10 tons.",
      "Increased draft increases water drag, and water drag reduces a vehicle's speed in water.  If you want your boat to go fast, make it as light as possible.",
      "Amphibious vehicles have both wheels and boat hulls.  As long as your amphibious vehicle has enough wheels on land and enough boat hulls to not sink in deep water, you can freely transition from land to water.  However, most amphibious vehicles are much slower in water than they are on land, so be careful when entering water to not leave your cruise control speed above your vehicle's safe water speed or you can burn out your engine!"

      "<color_light_gray>( Handguns</color>\nHandguns are small weapons held in one or both hands.  They are much more difficult to aim and control than larger firearms, and this is reflected in their poor accuracy.  However, their small size makes them appropriate for short-range combat.  They are also relatively quick to reload and use a very wide selection of ammunition.  Their small size and low weight make it possible to carry several loaded handguns, switching from one to the next once their ammo is spent.",
      "<color_green>( Crossbows</color>\nThe best feature of crossbows is their silence.  The bolts they fire are only rarely destroyed; if you pick up the bolts after firing them, your ammunition supply will last much longer.  Crossbows suffer from a short range and a very long reload time (modified by your strength); plus, most only hold a single round. \nFor this reason, it is advisable to carry a few loaded crossbows.  Crossbows can be very difficult to find; however, it is possible to craft one given enough Mechanics skill.  Likewise, it is possible to make wooden bolts from any number of wooden objects, though these are much less effective than steel bolts.  Crossbows use the handgun skill.",
      "<color_yellow>( Bows</color>\nSilent, deadly, easy to make, and the arrows are reusable.  Bows have been used forever.  Bows are two handed and require the user to have a certain strength level.  If you do not have enough strength to draw the string back, you will fire at a reduced effectiveness.  This reduces the reload and fire speeds and decreases the range of the arrows fired.  \nMost normal bows require strength of at least 8, others require an above average strength of 10, or a significant strength of 12.  Bows use the archery skill.",
      "<color_red>( Shotguns</color>\nShotguns are some of the most powerful weapons in the game, capable of taking out almost any enemy with a single hit.  Birdshot and 00 shot spread, making it very easy to hit nearby monsters.  However, they are very ineffective against armor, and some armored monsters might shrug off 00 shot completely.  Shotgun slugs are the answer to this problem; they also offer much better range than shot.\nThe biggest drawback to shotguns is their noisiness.  They are very loud, and impossible to silence.  A shot that kills one zombie might attract three more!  Beware of that.",
      "<color_cyan>( Submachine Guns</color>\nSubmachine guns are small weapons (some are barely larger than a handgun), designed for relatively close combat and the ability to spray large amounts of bullets.  However, they are more effective when firing single shots, so use discretion.  They mainly use the 9mm and .45 ammunition; however, other SMGs exist.  They reload moderately quickly, and are suitable for close or medium-long range combat.",
      "<color_brown>( Sniper and Marksman Rifles</color>\nSniper and marksman rifles are popular for their superior range and accuracy.  What's more, their scopes or sights make shots fired at targets at very long range as accurate as those with a shorter range.  Unlike assault rifles, sniper and marksman rifles usually have no automatic fire.  They are also may be slow to reload and fire, so when facing a large group of nearby enemies, they are not the best pick.",
      "<color_blue>( Assault Rifles</color>\nAssault rifles are similar to hunting rifles in many ways; they are also suited for long range combat, with similar bonuses and penalties.  Unlike hunting rifles, assault rifles are capable of automatic fire.  Assault rifles are less accurate than hunting rifles, and this is worsened under automatic fire, so save it for when you're highly skilled. \nAssault rifles are an excellent choice for medium or long range combat, or even close-range bursts again a large number of enemies.  They are difficult to use, and are best saved for skilled riflemen.",
      "<color_light_red>( Machine Guns</color>\nMachine guns are one of the most powerful firearms available.  They are even larger than assault rifles; however, they are capable of holding 100 or more rounds of highly-damaging ammunition.  They are not built for accuracy, and firing single rounds is not very effective.  However, they also possess a very high rate of fire and somewhat low recoil, making them very good at clearing out large numbers of enemies.",
      "<color_magenta>( Energy Weapons</color>\nEnergy weapons is an umbrella term used to describe a variety of rifles and handguns which fire lasers, plasma, or energy attacks.  They are mostly prototypes that started to appear in military use just prior to the start of the apocalypse, and as such are very difficult to find.\nEnergy weapons have no recoil at all; they are nearly silent, have a long range, and are fairly damaging.  The biggest drawback to energy weapons is scarcity of ammunition; it is wise to reserve the precious ammo for when you really need it."

    "name": "<4>: FAQ (contains spoilers!)",
    "messages": [
      "Q: What is Safe Mode, and why does it prevent me from moving?\nA: Safe Mode is a way to guarantee that you won't die by holding a movement key down.  When a monster comes into view, your movement will be ignored until Safe Mode is turned off with the ! key. This ensures that the sudden appearance of a monster won't catch you off guard.",
      "Q: It seems like everything I eat makes me sick! What's wrong?\nA: Lots of the food found in towns is perishable and will only last a few days after the start of a new game.  The electricity went out several days ago so fruit, milk and others are the first to go bad.  After the first couple of days, you should switch to canned food, jerky, and hunting.  Also, you should make sure to cook any food and purify any water you hunt up as it may contain parasites or otherwise be unsafe.",
      "Q: How can I remove boards from boarded-up windows and doors?\nA: Use a hammer and choose the direction of the boarded-up window or door to remove the boards.",
      "Q: The game just told me to quit, and other weird stuff is happening.\nA: You have the Schizophrenic trait, which might make the game seem buggy.",
      "Q: How can I prevent monsters from attacking while I sleep?\nA: Find a safe place to sleep, for example in a cleared building far from the front door.  Set traps if you have them, or build a fire to scare off wild animals.",
      "Q: Why do I always sink when I try to swim?\nA: Your swimming ability is reduced greatly by the weight you are carrying, and is also adversely affected by the clothing you wear.  Until you reach a high level of the swimming skill, you'll need to drop your equipment and remove your clothing to swim, making it a last-ditch escape plan.  Diving gear may significantly help you in swimming and diving.",
      "Q: How can I cure a fungal infection?\nA: Royal jelly, the Blood Filter bionic, and some antifungal chemicals can cure fungal infection.  You can find royal jelly in the bee hives which dot forests.  Antifungal chemicals to cure the fungal infection can either be found as random loot or made from other ingredients.",
      "Q: How do I get into science labs?\nA: You can enter the front door if you have an ID card by examining (<press_examine>) the keypad.  If you are skilled in computers and have an electrohack, it is possible to hack the keypad.  An EMP blast has a chance to force the doors open, but it's more likely to break them.  You can also sneak in through the sewers sometimes, or try to smash through the walls with explosions.",
      "Q: Why does my crafting fail so often?\nA: Check the difficulty of the recipe, and the primary skill used; your skill level should be around one and a half times the difficulty to be confident that it will succeed.",
      "Q: Why can't I carry anything?\nA: At the start of the game you only have the space in your pockets.  A good first goal of many survivors is to find a backpack or pouch to store things in.",
      "Q: Help!  I started a fire and now my house is burning down!\nA: Fires will spread to nearby flammable tiles if they are able.  Lighting a fire in a set-up brazier, stove, wood stove, stone fireplace, pit, or even in a kitchen stove will stop it from spreading.  Fire extinguishers can put out fires that get out of control.  You can put out a fire in the fireplace by examining it.",
      "Q: I'm cold and can't sleep at night!\nA: Gather some clothes and put them in the place you use to sleep in.  Being hungry, thirsty, wet, or injured can also make you feel the cold more, so try to avoid these effects before you go to sleep.  Pillows and some other appliances will help you sleep, and the quality of your sleeping spot is also very important.",
      "Q: There are too many calibers and guns.  It confuses me - I don't usually understand what is compatible with what.\nA: Try to remember few usual calibers: \n9x19 (or simply 9mm) - fits most basic pistols (Glock, for example) and SMGs, quite easy to find and gets job done versus usual zombies;\n 00 buckshot - for most shotguns.  Very powerful against unarmored target at closer ranges;\n .223 (5.56) - for rifles.  Good long range option.\n .308 (7.62) - for even more powerful rifles.  Also good long range option.\n  It should be enough in the beginning.  Or even just grab any shotgun, fill it with buckshot and give them hell!",
      "Q: I have a question that's not addressed here. How can I get an answer?\nA: Check the wiki, or ask the helpful people on the forum or at the chat channels. Links are provided in MOTD in the main menu."
