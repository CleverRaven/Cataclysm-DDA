      "Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a turn-based survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world.  You have survived the original onslaught, but the future looks pretty grim.",
      "You must prepare to face the many hardships to come, including dwindling supplies, hostile creatures, and harmful weather.  Even among fellow survivors you must stay alert, since someone may be plotting behind your back to take your hard-earned loot.",
      "Though one might think of Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead as a roguelike, it vastly differs from the traditional roguelikes in several ways.  Rather than exploring an underground dungeon, with a limited area on each level, you are exploring a truly infinite world, stretching in all four cardinal directions.  In this survival game, you will have to find food; you also need to keep yourself hydrated and sleep periodically.  It's based on the principle of realism, so expect all hardships you'd expect in life in a survival situation, and at least a dozen more from the eldritch and sci-fi nature of the Cataclysm itself.",
      "While Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead has more tasks to keep track of than many other games, the modern setting of the game makes some tasks easier.  Firearms, medications, and a wide variety of tools are all available to help you survive."

Your body nutrition level is distinct from your current hunger; for example, you may feel full after a big meal, while still being malnourished.  And you will still get hungry while being overweight.  With regular meals, you may even never get hungry and yet become malnourished, if your caloric intake is too low.

If you leave it be, the affected body part will develop a serious infection, and its status bar color will change to green.  At this stage, it is too late to disinfect the wound, and you need antibiotics to fight it.

      "THe hierarchy of needs for survival in most cases is as follows: shelter, fire, water, food.  The rest is the process of trying to answer a question: What would you do in a survival situation?",
      "The first thing to do, when you are out of immediate danger, is checking your starting location for useful items.  Your initial storage is limited, and a backpack, trenchcoat, or other storage medium will let you carry a lot more.  Finding a weapon is important, but not a first priority; frying pans, butcher knives, and more are common in houses, and hardware stores may have others, as well as useful tools.  Initially, save any guns you find as a last resort: ammo is scarce, while zombies are plenty, and unwanted attention may be more you can handle.",
      "It's also important to carry a few medications; painkillers are a must-have, and drugs such as cigarettes will make your life easier (but beware of addiction).  Leave the city as soon as you have a good stockpile of equipment: while their population density makes cities important places to find food, ammunition, and many other goods, the high concentration of zombies makes them a deathtrap for the unprepared survivor.",
      "Avoid combat whenever you can.  Run if you have to; but control your stamina, as zombies, unlike yourself, are inexhaustible.  Combat is always risky, and sometimes, one wrong step may be your last.  Therefore, in most cases you gain nothing from combat unless you are equipped for it and killing your enemy will help you achieve something.",
      "Combat is much easier if you can fight just one monster at a time.  You can sometimes kite singled-out zombies, drawing them to a place of your choosing.  Use doorways as a choke point or stand behind a window and strike as the zombies slowly climb through.  Be wary - in numbers, they will push through anyway.  Never be afraid to just run if you can outpace your enemies.  Irregular terrain, like forests, may help you lose monsters.",
      "Using firearms is the easiest way to kill an enemy, but the sound will attract unwanted attention.  Save the guns for emergencies, and melee when you can.",
      "If you need to protect yourself from acid, look for clothing made of plastic, Kevlar, leather, or cloth, in decreasing order of effectiveness.  So, while leather and Kevlar will protect you from active enemies, a hazmat suit and rubber boots will make you nigh immune to acid damage.  Items made of glass, ceramics, diamond, or precious metals will be totally immune to acid.",
      "When looting, try to fill your inventory as much as possible without being overloaded.  You never know when you might need an item, most are good to sell, and you can easily drop unwanted items on the floor.  But don't go looting empty-handed; you never know what might happen, so have your most crucial survival items with you.",
      "Keep an eye on the weather.  Wind and humidity will exacerbate dire conditions, so seek shelter if you're unable to withstand them.  Staying dry is important, especially if temperatures are so low that they would cause frostbite.  Use a towel to dry yourself if you are wet from the rain.  If you're having trouble staying warm overnight, make a pile of clothing on the floor to sleep on.  Finding a pillow and a blanket for your bed is always good for the quality of your sleep.  If you can't find those, improvise; even a chair in a basement is better then a patch of wet ground in a field.  Finding or making a shelter with a place to sleep is very important for your survival.",
      "Winter is harsh.  Liquids and food may freeze, and you may need to defrost them using a cooking appliance.  Placing them by a lit fire might also help.  Basements are warmer in winter and cooler in summer, so they are frequently good places to store your excess food.  Most food decays with time, and that process can be sped up or slowed down by the temperature.  Frozen food will not rot.  It you are able to bring a freezer or a fridge back to life, it will help you in the long run.  If these are out of your reach, think about constructing a root cellar.",
      "You may preserve food in many other ways, as well; for example, by using a smoking rack, or cooking it into a meal that has a longer shelf life."

      "Across the bottom is a summary of the most important parameters of your vehicle.  \"Safe speed\" is how fast you can drive without damaging the engine, and \"top\" speed is how fast you can drive at the engine's maximum output.  \"Acceleration\" is how fast your vehicle can increase speed each turn.  \"Cargo volume\" is how much cargo you can store and how much stuff you have in your vehicle, \"mass\" is how much the vehicle weighs, and the \"Status\" and \"Wheels\" readouts give a summary of the vehicle condition and wheel condition.  There are also fuel indicators on the lower right that give an estimate of how quickly your fuel will run out.",
      "Air drag, water drag, rolling drag, and static drag are all values that influence your vehicle's safe and maximum speed.  The interaction of drag and engine power is complicated, but generally speaking, more powerful engines will make your vehicle go faster but also consume fuel faster.",
      "Air drag increases as your vehicle gets wider or has more parts that increase the vehicle's height like full boards, aisles, or turrets.  It also increases as the vehicle assumes a less aerodynamic profile, such as by having exposed passengers or full boards at the front of the vehicle.  Air drag strongly influences vehicle speed, especially at high speeds.",
      "Rolling drag increases with vehicle weight and wheel count.  Rigid wheels have less rolling drag per wheel than inflatable wheels, but weigh more, so rolling drag may still increase when moving from inflatable wheels to rigid wheels.  Tank treads have enormous rolling resistance and are very heavy, so tanks have a lot of rolling resistance.  Rolling drag influences vehicle speed, but less than air drag does, especially at high speeds.",
      "Vehicles that can move in water have a water drag value.  Water drag increases with vehicle width and draft, and draft increases with vehicle weight, but is reduced by adding more boat boards and by widening or lengthening the vehicle.  Water drag has an enormous effect on vehicle speed in the water.  See the section on water vehicles for more about draft and water drag.",
      "Static drag includes things like plows, and directly reduces your vehicle's acceleration and top speed.",
      "\"Offroad\" is a rough estimate of how efficient your vehicle moves when not on pavement.  Your vehicle's safe speed, top speed, and acceleration are multiplied by roughly the offroad percentage value when your vehicle is not on the pavement.  The offroad percentage decreases as vehicle mass increases, and increases with the size and number of wheels.  Tank treads will give your vehicle an excellent offroad percentage but your vehicle will be slower due to the treads' very high rolling drag.",
      "Skilled survivors can use wrenches, hacksaws, and welding tools to add or remove parts on a vehicle.  You can even create a vehicle entirely from scratch, by using the Construction (<press_construction>) menu to 'Start Vehicle Construction' when you have a frame available.  Tuning a vehicle for speed, fuel consumption, offroad capacity, protection against threats, and cargo capacity is a complicated process.",
      "BOATS AND AMPHIBIOUS VEHICLES",
      "You can use boat hull parts to create boats or amphibious vehicles that can move between water and land.",
      "Each boat hull you add to your vehicle increases the height of the vehicle's watertight hull.  If the height of the watertight hull is less than the vehicle's draft, then water will flow into your vehicle, and it will sink and be destroyed if it goes into deep water.  If your vehicle's draft is less than the height of the watertight hull, your vehicle will not take on water and will not sink in deep water.",
      "Draft is determined by the length and width of your vehicle, the mass of your vehicle, and the percentage of the vehicle's underbody covered in boat hulls.  In general, a vehicle should be able to float if its mass in tons is less than a quarter of the product of its length and width, provided that the watertight hull is high enough.  A boat that is 5 tiles wide and 9 tiles long has a good chance of floating if all of its underbody is covered in boat boards and it weighs less than 10 tons.",
      "Increased draft increases water drag, and water drag reduces a vehicle's speed in water.  If you want your boat to go fast, make it as light as possible.",
      "Amphibious vehicles have both wheels and boat hulls.  As long as your amphibious vehicle has enough wheels on land and enough boat hulls to not sink in deep water, you can freely transition from land to water.  However, most amphibious vehicles are much slower in water than they are on land, so be careful when entering water to not leave your cruise control speed above your vehicle's safe water speed or you can burn out your engine!"

      "<color_light_gray>( Handguns</color>\nHandguns are small weapons held in one or both hands.  They are much more difficult to aim and control than larger firearms, and this is reflected in their poor accuracy.  However, their small size makes them appropriate for short-range combat.  They are also relatively quick to reload and use a very wide variety of ammunition.  Their small size and low weight make it possible to carry several loaded handguns, switching from one to the next as their ammo is spent.",
      "<color_green>( Crossbows</color>\nThe best feature of crossbows is their silence.  The bolts they fire are only rarely destroyed; if you pick up the bolts after firing them, your ammunition supply will last much longer.  Crossbows suffer from a short range and a very long reload time (modified by your strength); plus, most only hold a single round.\nFor this reason, it is advisable to carry a few loaded crossbows.  Crossbows can be very difficult to find; however, it is possible to craft one given a high enough Mechanics skill.  Likewise, it is possible to make wooden bolts from any number of wooden objects, though these are much less effective than steel bolts.  Crossbows use the handgun skill.",
      "<color_yellow>( Bows</color>\nSilent, deadly, relatively easy to make, and the arrows are reusable.  Bows have been used forever.  Bows are two-handed, and require the user to have a certain strength level.  If you do not have enough strength to draw the string back, you will fire at a reduced effectiveness.  This reduces the reload and fire speeds and decreases the range of the arrows fired.\nMost normal bows require strength of at least 8, others require an above average strength of 10, or a significant strength of 12.  Bows use the archery skill.",
      "<color_red>( Shotguns</color>\nShotguns are some of the most powerful weapons in the game, capable of taking out almost any enemy with a single hit.  Birdshot and 00 shot spread out after leaving the barrel, making it very easy to hit nearby monsters.  However, they are very ineffective against armor, and some armored monsters might shrug off 00 shot completely.  Shotgun slugs are the answer to this problem; they also offer much better range than shot.\nThe biggest drawback to shotguns is their noisiness.  They are very loud, and impossible to silence.  A shot that kills one zombie might attract three more!  Beware of that.",
      "<color_cyan>( Submachine Guns</color>\nSubmachine guns are small weapons (some are barely larger than a handgun), designed for relatively close combat and the ability to spray large numbers of bullets.  However, they are more effective when firing single shots, so use discretion.  They mainly use 9mm and .45 ammunition; however, other SMGs exist.  They reload moderately quickly, and are suitable for close or medium-long range combat.",
      "<color_brown>( Sniper and Marksman Rifles</color>\nSniper and marksman rifles are popular for their superior range and accuracy.  What's more, their scopes or sights make shots fired at targets at very long range as accurate as those fired at shorter range.  Unlike assault rifles, sniper and marksman rifles usually have no automatic fire.  They also may be slow to reload and fire, so when facing a large group of nearby enemies, they are not the best pick.",
      "<color_blue>( Assault Rifles</color>\nAssault rifles are similar to hunting rifles in many ways; they are also suited for long range combat, with similar bonuses and penalties.  Unlike hunting rifles, assault rifles are capable of automatic fire.  Assault rifles are less accurate than hunting rifles, and this is worsened under automatic fire, so save it for when you're highly skilled.\nAssault rifles are an excellent choice for medium or long range combat, or even close-range bursts against a large number of enemies.  They are difficult to use, and are best used by skilled riflemen.",
      "<color_light_red>( Machine Guns</color>\nMachine guns are one of the most powerful firearms available.  They are even larger than assault rifles; however, they are capable of holding 100 or more rounds of highly-damaging ammunition.  They are not built for accuracy, and firing single rounds is not very effective.  However, they also possess a very high rate of fire and somewhat low recoil, making them very good at clearing out large numbers of enemies.",
      "<color_magenta>( Energy Weapons</color>\n\"Energy weapons\" is an umbrella term used to describe a variety of rifles and handguns which fire lasers, plasma, or energy attacks.  They are mostly prototypes that started to appear in military use just prior to the start of the apocalypse, and as such are very difficult to find.\nEnergy weapons have no recoil at all; they are nearly silent, have a long range, and are fairly damaging.  The biggest drawback to energy weapons is scarcity of ammunition; it is wise to reserve the precious ammo for when you really need it."

    "messages": [
      "Q: What is Safe Mode, and why does it prevent me from moving?\nA: Safe Mode is a way to guarantee that you won't die by holding a movement key down.  When a monster comes into view, your movement will be ignored until Safe Mode is turned off with the <press_safemode> key.  This ensures that the sudden appearance of a monster won't catch you off guard.",
      "Q: It seems like everything I eat makes me sick!  What's wrong?\nA: Lots of the food found in towns is perishable and will only last a few days after the start of a new game.  The electricity went out several days ago, so fruit, milk, and similar foods are the first to go bad.  After the first couple of days, you should switch to canned food, jerky, and hunting.  Also, you should make sure to cook any food and purify any water you come across, as it may contain parasites or otherwise be unsafe.",
      "Q: How can I remove boards from boarded-up windows and doors?\nA: Use a hammer and choose the direction of the boarded-up window or door to remove the boards.",
      "Q: The game just told me to quit, and other weird stuff is happening.\nA: You have the Schizophrenic trait, which might make the game seem buggy.",
      "Q: How can I prevent monsters from attacking me while I sleep?\nA: Find a safe place to sleep; for example, in a cleared building far from the front door.  Set traps if you have them, or build a fire to scare off wild animals.",
      "Q: Why do I always sink when I try to swim?\nA: Your swimming ability is reduced greatly by the weight you are carrying, and is also adversely affected by most clothing you wear.  Until you reach a high level of the swimming skill, you'll need to drop your equipment and remove your clothing to swim, making it a last-ditch escape plan.  Diving gear may significantly help you in swimming and diving.",
      "Q: How can I cure a fungal infection?\nA: The Blood Filter bionic and some antifungal chemicals can cure fungal infection.  Antifungal chemicals to cure the fungal infection can either be found as random loot or made from other ingredients.",
      "Q: How do I get into science labs?\nA: You can enter the front door if you have an appropriate ID card by examining (<press_examine>) the keypad.  If you are skilled in computers and have an electrohack, it is possible to hack the keypad.  An EMP blast has a chance to force the doors open, but it's more likely to break them.  You can also sneak in through the sewers sometimes, or try to smash through the walls with explosions.",
      "Q: Why does my crafting fail so often?\nA: Check the difficulty of the recipe, and the primary skill used; your skill level should be around one and a half times the difficulty to be confident that it will succeed.  Also, note any proficiencies or other skills that may influence your chances of success.",
      "Q: Why can't I carry anything?\nA: At the start of the game you only have the space in your pockets.  A good first goal of many survivors is to find a backpack or pouch to store things in.",
      "Q: Help!  I started a fire and now my house is burning down!\nA: Fires will spread to nearby flammable tiles if they are able.  Lighting a fire in a deployed brazier, stove, wood stove, stone fireplace, pit, or even a kitchen stove will stop it from spreading.  Fire extinguishers can put out fires that get out of control.  You can put out a fire in a fireplace by examining it.",
      "Q: I'm cold and can't sleep at night!\nA: Gather some clothes and put them in the place where you're trying to sleep.  Being hungry, thirsty, wet, or injured can also make you feel the cold more, so try to avoid these effects before you go to sleep.  Pillows and some other appliances will help you sleep, and the quality of your sleeping spot is also very important.",
      "Q: There are too many calibers and guns.  It confuses me - I don't usually understand what is compatible with what.\nA: Try to remember a few common calibers:\n9x19 (or simply 9mm) - fits most basic pistols (Glock, for example) and SMGs, quite easy to find and gets job done against usual zombies;\n 00 buckshot - for most shotguns.  Very powerful against unarmored target at closer ranges;\n .223 (5.56) - for rifles.  Good long range option.\n .308 (7.62) - for even more powerful rifles.  Also a good long range option.\n  These should be enough in the beginning.  If you're still confused: just grab any shotgun, fill it with buckshot and give them hell!",
      "Q: I have a question that's not addressed here.  How can I get an answer?\nA: Check the wiki, or ask the helpful people on the forum or chat channels.  Links are provided in the MOTD in the main menu."
