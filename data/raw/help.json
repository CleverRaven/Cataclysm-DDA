  "Cataclysm is a survival roguelike with a monster apocalypse setting. You have survived the original onslaught, but the future looks pretty grim.",

  "You must prepare to face the many hardships to come including dwindling supplies, hostile creatures, and harmful weather. Even among fellow survivors you must stay alert, since someone may be plotting behind your back to take your hard-earned loot.",

  "Cataclysm differs from the traditional roguelikes in several ways. Rather than exploring an underground dungeon, with a limited area on each level, you are exploring a truly infinite world, stretching in all four cardinal directions. In this survival roguelike, you will have to find food; you also need to keep yourself hydrated and sleep periodically.",

  "While Cataclysm has more tasks to keep track of than many other roguelikes, the near-future setting of the game makes some tasks easier. Firearms, medications, and a wide variety of tools are all available to help you survive."
