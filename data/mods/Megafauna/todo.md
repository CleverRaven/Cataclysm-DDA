**ToDo**

*List of creatures that should be added* [done]
[done] -> First implementation done 
sabre-toothed cat (Smilodon fatalis) [done]
giant short-faced bear (Arctodus) [done]
long-nosed peccary [done]
flat-headed peccary [done]
woolly mammoth [done] (wool)
mastodon [done]
north american lion (Panthera atrox) [done]
dire wolf (Aenocyon dirus) [done]
stag-moose (Cervalces scotti) [done] (milk_low)
giant beaver (Castoroides) [done]
giant sloth (Megalonyx) [done]
shrub-ox (Euceratherium) [done]
woodox (Bootherium; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootherium) [done]
ancient bison, or equiv. (Bison antiquus) (wool, milk) [done]
Scott's horse (Equus scotti) (milk) [done]
Camelops (wool, milk) [done]

*potential candidates for addition with dubious range, or more research needed, or just more time*
- Soergelia meyfeldis, goatlike (need more research); https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soergelia;
- Great Auk (Pinguinus impennis), much later extinction but everything else fits, so indeed: why not?
- Glyptodonts, possibly (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyptodont)
- Harringtonhippus Francesci (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haringtonhippus)
- Equus Lambei (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equus_lambei)
- Homotherium (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotherium)
- American Cheetah (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_cheetah)

Possibly also some birds (Titanis/Paracrax/Aiolornis, Auk), if evidence exists and they are cool.
Possibly some kind of goat, maybe extinct pronghorn species?



*Add/adjust monster groups* [done]
Blacklist monsters that don't fit time frame:
- all domesticated animals (cows, pigs, goats, chicken, horses, cats, dogs) [done]
- introduced species (wild boars) [done]
- overlapping mutant variants (e.g, dire wolf) [done]
Add to monstergroups to initiate spawns [done]

---> this should now offer basic functionality

Add new monsters to monster groups/implement spawn:
- tweak spawn rates
- consider if spawns should occour in specific types of region (meaning, costum moster groups apart from "forest")
- extra: make "family" monstergroups that spawn adults and juveniles together in the appropriate season


*tests and tweaks*
- revamp descriptions (goal is immersive description, not wiki info or strategies how to deal with them)
- tweak factions/categories/sizes
- tweak combat stats (HP, damage etc 
    -> f.e., panthera atrox apparently bigger than smilodon?
    -> giant short faced bear might have been quite fast due to characteristically long limbs
    -> dire wolf might have been slower than modern wolves due to shorter limbs(theorized that scavanger more than hunter)
- tweak reproduction data (gestation times, grow-up-times etc)

*Additional/Future*
Think of cool stuff to do with animal products, like sabrecat teeth or mammoth tusks (i.e., adjust/make new harvest groups)
In any case, think about if recipes need to be adjusted for anything.
[done]Think about how some of these could fill gaps for farming, like peccaries as substitute for pig/boars, or anything woolly for... wool.
[partially done]Maybe add more flavourful special attacks
Think of specials that could fit (mammoth graveyard, sabrecat caves, watering holes with lots of animals, )

*Unlikely, but not unthinkable future additions*
More widespread scope both timeframe and geographically
Late Pleistocene Flora
Touch mapgen to create more realistic pleistocene biomes
Mutations/Mutagen line fitting the setting (Mammoth Mutagen, for example)
