**Description**
Through the portals rupturing reality in the cataclysm, you were sucked into a world yet untouched by humans. Here you encounter massive animals that seem almost out of place, but eerily familiar at the same time. You know this megafauna went extinct just around the time your ancestors first set foot on this land some 10.000 years ago. Distant memories of these Pleistocenic animals rest deep in your conscious. 

Adds 16 lorefriendly megafauna species especially suited for innawood playthroughs. Features all-time favorites like Woolly Mammoths, Mastodons and Sabre-toothed Cats. Hunt them ruthlessly like our ancestors did, or befriend and try to domesticate them. But beware you don't get eaten or trampled before.

At the same time, species introduced in modern times are removed! E.g.: wild boars, cows, cats, dogs, ... 


**Goals and Scope**
The goal of the mod is to add extinct megafauna of the late Pleistocene and early holocene (about 30.000-8.000 BCE), that the first humans setting foot on the area CDDA mostly uses as a real world counterpart, New England, have encountered.

The mod aims to provide a more realistic fauna for wilderness/stone age playthroughs, especially together with the innawood mod, or as a more mammal-focused addition together with the DinoMod (seems to work together, but might need tweaking). Part of that goal is that some species encountered in New England today which are quite new additions to the biosphere (like the wild boar) will be replaced by species more fitting to the time frame. These animals can fill niches for human use, not only regarding meat, but also wool and milk, that are currently only covered by modern day farm animals.

Geographically, species from modern day New England are the focus, again for a more coherent, realistic feel. If evidence is found not too far away in not too different climates (e.g., Great Lakes) thats alright too. If remains of a species have only been found in, e.g., New Mexiko and Texas, they probably wont feature here.

**NOTE**
This mod is still work-in-progress, but a basic set of 16 new Pleistocene-era animals is available, should spawn in new games and be generally useful especially for innawood players.

**full list of new animals**
- woolly mammoths
- mastodons
- sabre toothed cat
- dire wolf
- american cave lion
- giant short faced bear
- flat headed peccary (a distant cousin of wild boars)
- long nosed peccary (a distant cousin of wild boars)
- stag moose (aka Giant Moose)
- giant beaver
- large claw sloth
- shrub-ox
- wood-ox
- ancient bison 
- scott's horse
- camelops (giant American camel species)

**domesticated replacements**
*Usage* (modern analogue): MEGAFAUNA replacement

*meat/leather production* (pigs) = flat headed peccaries (sligthly smaller, but otherwise sameish use).

*wool* (sheep) = mammoths, if you are brave enough. otherwise bison, camelops, oxen, giant sloth and muskox [WIP].

*milk* (cow, goat) = bison, oxen, horse and camelops are milkable, but with varying efficiency.

*transport* (horse, cow) = long nose peccary, scotts horse, mammoth/Mastodon, bison/ox, camelops are rideable.

*eggs* (chicken, ducks, geese) = Auks[WIP]; ducks and geese are still in.

*pet* (dogs, cats) = dire wolves and sabre cats are tamable pets, a few other tameable creatures can be petted as well.


**Development Notes/ToDo**

**ToDo**
*potential candidates for addition with dubious range, or more research needed, or just more time*
- Soergelia meyfeldis, goatlike (need more research); https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soergelia;
- Great Auk (Pinguinus impennis), much later extinction but everything else fits, so indeed: why not?
- Glyptodonts, possibly (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyptodont)
- Harringtonhippus Francesci (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haringtonhippus)
- Equus Lambei (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equus_lambei)
- Homotherium (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotherium)
- American Cheetah (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_cheetah)
- Tapir veroensis https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapirus_veroensis 

Possibly also some birds (Titanis/Paracrax/Aiolornis, Auk), if evidence exists and they are cool.
Possibly some kind of goat, maybe extinct pronghorn species?

*Add/adjust monster groups* [done]
Blacklist monsters that don't fit time frame:
- all domesticated animals (cows, pigs, goats, chicken, horses, cats, dogs) [done]
- introduced species (wild boars) [done]
- overlapping mutant variants (e.g, dire wolf) [done]
Add to monstergroups to initiate spawns [done]

---> this should now offer basic functionality

Add new monsters to monster groups/implement spawn:
- tweak spawn rates
- consider if spawns should occour in specific types of region (meaning, costum moster groups apart from "forest")
- extra: make "family" monstergroups that spawn adults and juveniles together in the appropriate season


*tests and tweaks*
- revamp descriptions (goal is immersive description, not wiki info or strategies how to deal with them)
- tweak factions/categories/sizes
- tweak combat stats (HP, damage etc 
    -> f.e., panthera atrox apparently bigger than smilodon?
    -> giant short faced bear might have been quite fast due to characteristically long limbs
    -> dire wolf might have been slower than modern wolves due to shorter limbs(theorized that scavanger more than hunter)
- tweak reproduction data (gestation times, grow-up-times etc)

*Additional/Future*
Think of cool stuff to do with animal products, like sabrecat teeth or mammoth tusks (i.e., adjust/make new harvest groups)
In any case, think about if recipes need to be adjusted for anything.
[done]Think about how some of these could fill gaps for farming, like peccaries as substitute for pig/boars, or anything woolly for... wool.
[partially done]Maybe add more flavourful special attacks
Think of specials that could fit (mammoth graveyard, sabrecat caves, watering holes with lots of animals, )

*Unlikely, but not unthinkable future additions*
More widespread scope both timeframe and geographically
Late Pleistocene Flora
Touch mapgen to create more realistic Pleistocene biomes
Mutations/Mutagen line fitting the setting (Mammoth Mutagen, for example)
