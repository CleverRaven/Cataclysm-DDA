**Goals and Scope**
The goal of the mod is to add extinct megafauna of the late pleistocene and early holocene (about 30.000-8.000 BCE), that the first humans setting foot on the area CDDA mostly uses as a real world counterpart, New England, have encountered.

The mod aims to provide a more realistic fauna for wilderness/stone age playthroughs, especially together with the innawoods mod, or as a more mammal-focused addition together with the DinoMod (testing of compatibility not done yet, though!). Part of that goal is that some species encountered in New England today which are quite new additions to the biosphere (like the wild boar) will be replaced by species more fitting to the time frame. These animals can fill niches for human use, not only regarding meat, but also wool and milk, that are currently only covered by modern day farm animals.

Geographically, species from modern day New England are the focus, again for a more coherent, realistic feel. If evidence is found not too far away in not too different climates (e.g., Great Lakes) thats alright too. If remains of a species have only been found in, e.g., New Mexiko and Texas, they probably wont feature here.

**NOTE**
This mod is still work-in-progress, but a basic set of 16 new pleistocene-era animals is available, should spawn in new games and be generally useful especially for innawoods players.

**full list of new animals**
- woolly mammoths
- mastodons
- sabre toothed cat
- dire wolf
- american cave lion
- giant short faced bear
- flat headed peccary (a distant cousin of wild boars)
- long nosed peccary (a distant cousin of wild boars)
- stag moose (aka Giant Moose)
- giant beaver
- large claw sloth
- shrub-ox
- wood-ox
- ancient bison 
- scott's horse
- camelops (giant American camel species)

**domesticated replacements**
*Usage* (modern analogue): MEGAFAUNA replacement

*meat/leather production* (pigs) = flat headed peccaries (sligthly smaller, but otherwise sameish use).

*wool* (sheep) = mammoths, if you are brave enough. otherwise bison, camelops, oxen, giant sloth and muskox [WIP].

*milk* (cow, goat) = bison, oxen, horse and camelops are milkable, but with varying efficiency.

*transport* (horse, cow) = long nose peccary, scotts horse, mammoth/Mastodon, bison/ox, camelops are rideable.

*eggs* (chicken, ducks, geese) = Auks[WIP]; ducks and geese are still in.

*pet* (dogs, cats) = dire wolves and sabre cats are tamable pets, a few other tameable creatures can be petted as well.
