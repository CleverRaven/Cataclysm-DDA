# Goal

The goal of the mod is to add extinct megafauna.

# ToDo

- *Add these mosnter stats:*
sabre-toothed cat (Smilodon fatalis) [done]
giant short-faced bear (Arctodus) [done]
long-nosed peccary [done]
flat-headed peccary [done]
woolly mammoth and/or columbian mammoth
mastodon
north american lion (Panthera atrox)
dire wolf (Aenocyon dirus)
stag-moose (Cervalces scotti)
giant beaver (Castoroides) 
glyptodonts, possibly (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyptodont)
giant sloth (Megalonyx)
shrub-ox, or woodox (Euceratherium/Bootherium; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootherium)
muskox (Ovibos moschatus)
ancient bison, or equiv. (Bison antiquus)


*dubious range, or more research needed*
Soergelia meyfeldis, ziegenartige (need more research); https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soergelia;
Scott's horse (Equus scotti), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equus_scotti, or different species; probably also in NE, because of long history until extinction;
Camelops, american camel species, evidence as far as tennessee, but such a long history that NE is a good bet https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelops


Possibly also some birds (Titanis/Paracrax/Aiolornis), if evidence exists and they are cool.
Possibly some kind of goat, maybe extinct pronghorn species.

What else?

- *Add/adjust monster groups*
Blacklist monsters that don't fit

- *Additional/Future*
Think of cool stuff to do with ancient animal products, like sabrecat teeth or mammoth tusks.
In any case, think about if recipes need to be adjusted for anything.
Think about how some of these could fill gaps for farming, like peccaries as substitute for pig/boars, or anything woolly for... wool.
