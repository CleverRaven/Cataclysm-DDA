**Goals and Scope**

The goal of the mod is to add extinct megafauna of the late pleistocene and early holocene (about 30.000-8.000 BCE), that the first humans setting foot on the area CDDA mostly uses as a real world counterpart, New England, have encountered.
The mod aims to provide a more realistic fauna for wilderness/stone age playthroughs, especially together with the innawoods mod, or as a more mammal-focused addition together with the DinoMod. Part of that goal is that some species encountered in New England today which are quite new additions to the biosphere (like the wild boar) will be replaced by species more fitting to the time frame. These animals can fill niches for human use, not only regarding meat, but also wool and milk, that are currently only covered by modern day farm animals.

Geographically, species from modern day New England are the focus, again for a more coherent, realistic feel. If evidence is found not too far away in not too different climates (e.g., Great Lakes) thats alright too. If remains of a species have only been found in, e.g., New Mexiko and Texas, they probably wont feature here.

**NOTE**

This mod is still in progress, but a basic set of 16 new pleistocene-era animals is available and should spawn in new games.

**ToDo**

*List of creatures that should be added* [done]
[done] -> First implementation done 
sabre-toothed cat (Smilodon fatalis) [done]
giant short-faced bear (Arctodus) [done]
long-nosed peccary [done]
flat-headed peccary [done]
woolly mammoth [done] (wool)
mastodon [done]
north american lion (Panthera atrox) [done]
dire wolf (Aenocyon dirus) [done]
stag-moose (Cervalces scotti) [done] (milk_low)
giant beaver (Castoroides) [done]
giant sloth (Megalonyx) [done]
shrub-ox (Euceratherium) [done]
woodox (Bootherium; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootherium) [done]
ancient bison, or equiv. (Bison antiquus) (wool, milk) [done]
Scott's horse (Equus scotti) (milk) [done]
Camelops (wool, milk) [done]

*potential candidates for addition with dubious range, or more research needed, or just more time*
- Soergelia meyfeldis, goatlike (need more research); https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soergelia;
- Great Auk (Pinguinus impennis), much later extinction but everything else fits, so indeed: why not?
- Glyptodonts, possibly (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyptodont)
- Harringtonhippus Francesci (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haringtonhippus)
- Equus Lambei (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equus_lambei)
- Homotherium (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotherium)
- American Cheetah (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_cheetah)

Possibly also some birds (Titanis/Paracrax/Aiolornis, Auk), if evidence exists and they are cool.
Possibly some kind of goat, maybe extinct pronghorn species?



*Add/adjust monster groups* [done]
Blacklist monsters that don't fit time frame:
- all domesticated animals (cows, pigs, goats, chicken, horses, cats, dogs) [done]
- introduced species (wild boars) [done]
- overlapping mutant variants (e.g, dire wolf) [done]
Add to monstergroups to initiate spawns [done]

---> this should now offer basic functionality

Add new monsters to monster groups/implement spawn:
- tweak spawn rates
- consider if spawns should occour in specific types of region (meaning, costum moster groups apart from "forest")
- extra: make "family" monstergroups that spawn adults and juveniles together in the appropriate season


*tests and tweaks*
- revamp descriptions (goal is immersive description, not wiki info or strategies how to deal with them)
- tweak factions/categories/sizes
- tweak combat stats (HP, damage etc 
    -> f.e., panthera atrox apparently bigger than smilodon?
    -> giant short faced bear might have been quite fast due to characteristically long limbs
    -> dire wolf might have been slower than modern wolves due to shorter limbs(theorized that scavanger more than hunter)
- tweak reproduction data (gestation times, grow-up-times etc)
-  


*Additional/Future*
Think of cool stuff to do with animal products, like sabrecat teeth or mammoth tusks (i.e., adjust/make new harvest groups)
In any case, think about if recipes need to be adjusted for anything.
Think about how some of these could fill gaps for farming, like peccaries as substitute for pig/boars, or anything woolly for... wool.
Maybe add more flavourful special attacks
Think of specials that could fit (mammoth graveyard, sabrecat caves, watering holes with lots of animals, )

*Unlikely, but not unthinkable future additions*
More widespread scope both timeframe and geographically
Late Pleistocene Flora
Touch mapgen to create more realistic pleistocene biomes
Mutations/Mutagen line fitting the setting (Mammoth Mutagen, for example)

**domesticated replacements**
*meat/leather production*(pigs) = flat headed peccaries (sligthly smaller, but otherwise sameish use)

*wool* (sheep) = mammoths? seems awesome, but a bit over the top too. otherwise bison variants, musk oxen, camelops

*milk* (cow, goat) = bison, oxen, possibly horse?, possibly camelops?

*transport* (horse, cow) = long nose peccary, scotts horse, mammoth/Mastodon, bison/ox, camelops

*eggs* (chicken, ducks, geese) = Auks, but ducks and geese are already fine

*pet* (dogs, cats) = make bobcats pets, dire wolves, larger cats as well?
