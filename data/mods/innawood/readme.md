# Goal

The goal of the mod is to create a 'innawood' experience, where the player can experience exploring an untouched land, and have to craft rather than loot everything they want to use.
- Removal of manmade items: The goal is to remove the spawning of all man made items and structures. Especially if they could give the survivor an edge.
- Make the game more 'innawood' friendly: Several recipes have been added or tweaked. The goal is to make it possible to get to at least around late medieval technology on your own.
- A shift towards a longer, less eventful, more stationary lifestyle. It might take a third of a season to get enough metal to even craft an anvil. Hopefully this will encourage players to plant crops and make plans for surviving the winter.

# Changes

- Cities, roads, cabins, and most other man made structures have been removed.
- Caves and monster locations that spawned cool loot now mostly spawn natural items instead.
- Sand spawns somewhat commonly in plains.
- Get a lot of withered plants from smashing young trees.
- Bog iron can be extracted and refined to allow metalworking.
- The old ammonia recipe is back.
- Ammonia, glass from sand, cattail jelly, quicklime, cement, and mortar are auto learned.
- Mortar can be made without a cement mixer, but now requires water.
- Man made junk found on the ground or though foraging is removed.
- You can make nails without first needing a nail.
