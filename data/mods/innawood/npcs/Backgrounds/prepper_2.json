But I still saw some stuff from where I was.  I watched those things stride past.  I still have nightmares about the way their bodies moved, like they broke the world just to be here.  I had nothing better to do.  I watched them rip up those goons with weapons, watched the dead rise back up and start fighting the living.  I watched a nice old lady rip the head off a dog.  I saw a body twitch and grow into some kind of electrified hulk beast.  I watched it all happen.",

I thought I wouldn't last a minute out here, but I couldn't bring myself to end it back there.  I headed out, planning to let the <zombies> finish me off, but what can I say?  Survival instinct is a funny thing, and I killed the ones outside the hideout.  I guess the adrenaline was what I needed.  It's kept me going since then.",
