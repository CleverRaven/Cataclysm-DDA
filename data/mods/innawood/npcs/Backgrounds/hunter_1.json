I hear it was easier the farther out you were, the big bad monsters liked to go where there were a lot of people ready and waiting to be taken.  Doesn't matter to me, I was out on my end-of-winter hunting trip, I'd been out for a week already.  First clue I had things were going wrong was when I saw a fluffy pink mushroom cloud out near a big burned up field, way out in the middle of nowhere.  I didn't think much about that.  Then I was attacked by a dream demon.",

I saw it before it saw me, and I capped it with my blunderbuss.  That just pissed it off, but I got another shot off while it charged me.  It got me, but I managed to end it first.  I figured out shit had hit the oyster shell, somehow.  Headed to my shelter and camped out there for a while, but I had to skip out when a bunch of giant bees showed up and trashed the place.  I ran into you not much later.",
