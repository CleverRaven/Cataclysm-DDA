In the morning I heard someone talking, so I went to see.  I was playing it pretty careful though, there were still a lot of psychos and rioters around.  I snuck up on some kind of thing, some monster worse than any zombie.  Some huge bug thing, saying random phrases like some kind of broken tape recorder.  It was dragging a few human bodies behind it, I couldn't tell if they were dead or unconscious.  Honestly I didn't wait to find out, I ducked into the bushes and tried not to breath until I couldn't hear it anymore.",

It started with riots, and they had to dispatch violent goons to take care of the <swear> criminals.  The leadership tried to pad it claiming it was some kind of mind control, but I didn't see too much different from the usual bullshit: entitled babies looking for an excuse to break the law.  It just got way worse, this time, until it was time to get away.  I heard rumors they were even burning some places to try to control it - which, I have to admit, is maybe a bit too hard-core.",
