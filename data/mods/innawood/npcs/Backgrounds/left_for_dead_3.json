I didn't go down there expecting to chant and march, I grabbed a rock and went out planning to fuck shit up.  I've never felt so angry before.  The riots had already been going on a while at that point, and to me, it just looked like the man trying to squash the people again.",

Says something about my frame of mind that I don't even remember if I'd seen them before that point.

That's when I started seeing the mob for what it was, seeing the wild-eyed animals, even the zombies.  I turned and ran.",

Things were bad, there were some really awful crimes happening, and there was a lot of racial tension as usual from the way the enforcers were handling it.

That doesn't explain anything else though: the zombies, the monsters, all this stuff is way off base.  Anything I've tried to guess just sounds like scary stories, like demonic curses or alien weapons kinda stuff.",
