There were the plaguesâ€¦ the first one was the one a couple years ago, that was when people started talking about the end being near.  Then there was a plague of blood, or was it violence?  That was the riots.  Then the seas turned red with blood, that was from all the people being killed.  Then a plague of fire, I remember that one for sure, there were fires set everywhere to try to contain the riots.  And then demons and monsters walked the Earth, and the dead rose from their graves, and finally the meek inherited.  Clear as day.",
