I actually lived there for a while with three others.  One guy who I guess had a lot of good mojo kinda ran the show, because he seemed to really know what was going on.  Spoiler alert: he <swear> didn't.",

My best guess it was some huge  overreach, maybe some kind of experimental weapon that got away.  They tried to lie so much at the start about everything that was going on, I don't think any of it measures up.  They were trying to cover something up.  As for the real end times, maybe the rest of the world tried to contain it.  I heard about all kinds of wild stuff.  To me that seems like somewhere else trying to get whatever is going on here contained.  Maybe it even worked.  It's bad now but it's not like it was.",
