We'd heard about riots… all kinds of nasty stories, like the one where the woman is biting this guy's face, and her whole lower lip has been ripped off, and is just flapping there?  It got so bad, the teachers told us there were drugs in the water and we should pray.  Right… does anyone buy that explanation?",
