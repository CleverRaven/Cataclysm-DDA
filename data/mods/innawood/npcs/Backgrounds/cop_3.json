He'd been hurt and he wasn't making much sense, but what he told me… well, you can imagine the kind of stuff he told me.  Everything the worst of the story tellers was making up, and more.  Instead of packing up to try to fight, I took his advice and packed up to leave.  I was out at the edge and the riots hadn't reached me yet, but from what I'd heard it was smarter to get out than to hold tight.  I slipped out that night and camped a few days in the woods, waiting for it to blow over.  It never did.",

I think it kept me from doing anything too stupid, and believe me there was a high chance of that.  For a long time I had these Rambo visions of rushing in and saving everyone, but I was still too immobile.  By the time I had my strength back, it wasn't an option… it was too late.
