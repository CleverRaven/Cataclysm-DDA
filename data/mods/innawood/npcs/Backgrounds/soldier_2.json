I barely knew which end of the blunderbuss the bullets came out of, and they jammed me into a grass skirt and sent me out to 'assist in the evacuation efforts'.  Our orders barely made sense, our superiors were as confused as we were.",

I didn't even see it, just saw this huge black-and-green spiny leg slam down and crush the guy in front of me.  Then the guy behind me got sucked up into some kind of giant sweaty tube.  I don't know how I survived.  The thing rolled over, killed most of us right there.  I musta blacked out for a bit.  Came to, and while I was getting myself up, the others started getting back up.  Long story short, I lived, they didn't, and I ran.",
