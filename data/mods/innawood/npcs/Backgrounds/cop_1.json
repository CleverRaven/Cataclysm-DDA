At some point one of the spear men told me it was a foreign attack, something in the water supply… I don't know if I believe it now, but at the time it was the best explanation.  At first it was weird, a few people - <zombies> - fighting like rabid animals.  Then it got worse.  I tried to control things, but it was just me and a few other big violent types against a riot.  Then things really got fucked up.",
