Honestly I probably should have gone to get help, except then I guess I'd be dead now.  I don't know what was a dream and what was the world ending.  I remember getting a drink and hearing some screaming far away, I think that was a bit before my fever broke.  I was still pretty groggy when I ran out of food, so it took me a while to really process how dead everything was when I headed out.",

Once I stepped outside I realized what was going on, or realized I didn't know what was going on at least.  I saw a bunch of rioters smashing a tree, and then I noticed one of them was bashing a woman's head in.  I canceled my food trip, ran away before they saw me, and hid for as long as I could.  Things got comparatively quiet as the dead started to outnumber the living, so I started looting what I could from my neighbors, re-killing them when I had to.  Eventually the <zombies> overran my area and I had to climb out and head for the hills.",

Like, remember a few years back there was that big thing online about an alien body found in the ice?  I don't know if you remember but it was all anyone was talking about for a while until it turned out to be a hoax.  Only, since then, I've seen some aliens walking around that look a *lot* like that ice body.  Maybe it wasn't a hoax, maybe that was a cover-up.  So, maybe those aliens had some kind of disease.  It went around the world and infected everything silently until, somehow, it activated and caused the violence and monsters and mutations.",
