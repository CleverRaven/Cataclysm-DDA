I had a splitting headache, no clothes, and absolutely no memory of anything.  Like, I know stuff.  I can talk, I have skills and understanding… but I don't remember where any of it comes from.  I'm not even sure my name is real or if I made it up.",

I just have this feeling.  Maybe losing my mind is a mercy.  Hell, maybe it's some kind of psychotic break and my brain did this to itself.  To be honest with you I think I'd rather focus on surviving, and not worry about it.",
