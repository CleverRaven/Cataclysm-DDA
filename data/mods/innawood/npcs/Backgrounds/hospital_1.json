Wasn't my training so I didn't hear about it until later… but rumors started flying about hyperaggressive delirious patients that coded and seemed to die, then started attacking people, and wouldn't respond to anything we hit them with.  Then a friend of mine was killed by one of them, and I realized it wasn't just a few weird reports.  I called in sick the next day.",

I didn't even try to argue… I had my dad's old pistol, but they had numbers and seemed a little crazed.  I heard one of them joking about the camp being a death camp, though.  I went with them but as soon as I could I gave them the slip and decided to make for my sister's place up north.  In theory I guess I'm still going that way, although honestly I'm just busy not dying.",
