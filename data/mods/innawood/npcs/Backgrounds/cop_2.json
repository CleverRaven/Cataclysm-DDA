By all rights I should be dead.  We were called to control \"riots\", which we all know were the first <zombie> hordes.  Fat lot of good we were.  Pretty sure we killed more civilians.  Even among my crew, morale was piss poor and we were shooting wild.  Then something hit us, something big.  Might have been a bomb, I really don't remember.  I woke up pinned underneath a lot of bodies.  I couldn't see anything… but I could hear it, <swear!>.  I could hear everything.  I spent hours, maybe days under those bodies, not even trying to get out.",

I decided to try to pull myself out and see how bad my injuries were.  It was <very> easy.  The people on top of me were torn open, and it turned out I was basically just lying under a little debris, with parts of people tented around me.  I wasn't even too badly hurt.  I grabbed as much to eat as I could, and I slipped away.  It was night.  I could hear fighting farther away in the woods, so I went the other way.  I made it a while before I ran into any <zombies>… I ran from them.  I ran, and I ran, and I ran some more.  And here I am.",
