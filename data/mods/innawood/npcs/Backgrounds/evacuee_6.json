And then the cave got too crowded, and people were waiting to get taken further out, but no one ever came to take them.  You must already know about all that.  It turned into panic, and then fighting.  I didn't stick around to see what happened next; I headed into the woods.  I went back a few days later, but the place was totally abandoned.  No idea what happened to all those people.",

    "dynamic_line": "I gotta be honest with you, I heard a lot of stories back at the cave, and only one of them really stuck.  This is some kind of magic experiment gone wrong.  I don't know what caused the riots and the undead in the first place, but there's no way it's this out of control everywhere.  Yeah, I heard the same scary stories as everyone, but it doesn't make *sense* that it could be so widespread so fast.  I think we're in some sort of exclusion zone, where they're letting whatever is going on run its course to see how it works so they can fight it better next time.  Somewhere out there, outside the zone, it's more or less business as usual.",
