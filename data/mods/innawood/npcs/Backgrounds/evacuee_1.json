I thought it was the usual stuff at first, and I gotta admit, I was sort of excited and scared it was the start of a revolution.  Not excited enough to join in though, and I guess anyone who was is probably dead now.  I tried to wait it alone, packed a little bag, but I saw a rioter get back up and fight with crazy injuries.  I don't know how many people really believed it at first, but I took that as my sign and ran for a nearby cave I knew.  I don't know exactly what happened after that.  I thought others would be there but it was just me.",
