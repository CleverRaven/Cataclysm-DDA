I don't know how I got where I am now, or how any of this happened.  I think something pretty bad must have happened to me.  Or maybe I was just hit in the head really hard.  Or both.  Both seems likely.  First thing I remember is seeing a beautiful young woman with her face covered with blood, laughing and saying everything had fallen and it was all over.",
