When the riots started, I think I was already primed to think of it as something different from a normal equality riot or anything like that.  I think that's part of how I got out safer, I had had some time to get some stuff and get going.  People were abso-fuckin-lutely crazy in those days.

I saw this one woman eat her own baby.  I don't know what it was about it, something about the look on her face.  Now we've both seen worse things with our own eyes, but that one still comes back to haunt me.  Anyway, they never could control the riots, and by the time the rioters started turning into undead it was way too late.  I don't know if morale just broke or what but I heard rumors it just became a free for all bloodletting.  What actually made the dead come back to life though?  I haven't got a clue.",
