I guess they think I'm dead, so they'll steer clear of this hellhole, and that's the best as could be.",

My horse had taken some bad hits though, and I found out the hard way when he stumbled and fell and I broke my ass.  Made it a few miles before I wound up stuck in the ass-end of nowhere.  I settled in to wander.  I guess I'm still kinda heading north, just by a pretty round-about way, you know?",
