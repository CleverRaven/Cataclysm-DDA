Hi, thanks for reading. This is a brief overview of the things I (Renech) am looking to do with this mod, and that might be accepted if you PR them before I do:

-Disable/blacklist all populated overmap specials. Bandit fort in particular can spawn in cities and is really inappropriate! But also including things like the refugee center, etc. They're just eating up CPU time right now, despite never being placeable.

-Minor: Whitelist a single start location

-Some better form of placing the cities so they truly do overlap and every tile is filled in. There should be **zero** fields, forests, or non-urban buildings.

-Better handling of the city "commercial district" vs suburbia. Right now the suburbia is immense; I want small pockets of surburbia buttressed by enormous oceans of high-rise and commercial buildings.
--Update: I have disappeared all the suburbia. Good, but also bad. Need to modify the sigma value so that very rarely small pockets of suburbia can be generated in the cities.

-Some form of "stick" that forces the player to constantly migrate to new untouched areas of the city. Being stuck in an endless city is only interesting if you're actually stuck there. If you've killed everything within a mile and you can sit with your feet up, it's pointless.
--Possibly, disabling agriculture altogether should be part of this. Food pressure is definitely one way.
--Thirst pressure might be more relevant since there are no rivers.
---Note I am NOT looking for some sort of magical or otherwordly explanation. This is not "liminal space", it's just a big, infinite-enough city. Purposefully no explanation should be given.

-Remove any infinite sources of water (to increase the thirst pressure). This includes backyard pools, parks with water tiles, etc. This does not include just clean water.

-More messy cities, barricades on the streets, etc. The aim is to make vehicular travel purposefully difficult.
--This can probably go straight into vanilla DDA, so PR it there first.
