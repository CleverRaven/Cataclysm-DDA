# Alternative Map Key

This mod replaces most of the symbols used for ASCII overmap keys. This has no effect on the large overmap screen when using overmap tiles (tiles enabled by default). 
It will still replace the symbols used in the overmap in your sidebar.  

## General Guidelines
Land features are symbols. They're in big chunks so you don't really need a letter to tell you what each space is. 
For the same reason, houses are left as they were.  

Buildings will be represented by the first letter of their name. P for Pizza not Parlor. 

### Single Tile Buildings
Letters are all lower case.  
Colors are non-inverted.

### Multi Tile Buildings
Letters are all lower case.  
Colors are inverted. 
Parking lots are treated as single tile buildings so will be non-inverted colors.
