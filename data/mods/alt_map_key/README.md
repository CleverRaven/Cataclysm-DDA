# Alternative Map Key

This mod replaces most of the symbols used for ASCII overmap keys. This has no effect on the large overmap screen when using overmap tiles (tiles enabled by default). 
It will still replace the symbols used in the overmap in your sidebar.  

## General Guidelines
Land features are symbols. They're in big chunks so you don't really need a letter to tell you what each space is. 
For the same reason, houses are left as they were.  

Buildings will be represented by the first letter of their name. P for Pizza not Parlor. 

### Single Tile Buildings
Letters are all lower case.  
Colors are non-inverted.

### Multi Tile Buildings
The road connection or entrance is marked with a capital letter.  
Colors are inverted. 

### Colors
Colors mark the (loose) thematic category, with some compromises between the building's original purpose and its current lootability. 

- Blue - Service and Entertainment. (low loot.) 
  - Laundromats, gyms, arcade, football field, radio, movie theaters, amusement parks, spas, hair salons, etc
    - Blue on black is hard to see, so it was used for places you don't often scan the map for. Ponds and related locations that are mostly natural water are also blue with `#` as their sign.
