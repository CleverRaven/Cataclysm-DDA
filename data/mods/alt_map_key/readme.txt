Symbols are used for land features. They're in big chunks so you don't really need a letter to tell you what each space is. For the same reason, houses are left as they were.  

Normal buildings just use the first letter in the site's name. P for Pizza not Parlor. Letters are all lower case and non-inverted. A few places were renamed to cut down on duplicates; power substations are now electric substations, etc.

Multi-tile sites have inverted colors. The road connection or entrance (or lab stair) is marked with a capital letter.

Colors mark the (loose) thematic category, with some comprimises between the building's original purpose and its current lootability.
