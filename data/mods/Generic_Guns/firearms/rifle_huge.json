Though it resembles a sniper rifle, this anti-material weapon is best suited for blinding tanks, shooting at aircraft, or destroying explosives.  It feeds from comically oversized magazines.",

    "description": "Elegantly engraved, with deep glossy blued steel and figured wood, this break-action double rifle is almost too nice to shoot.  Your shoulder might beg you not to; the chambers are almost wide enough for two fingers and the recoil is monstruous.  You could probably kill anything with this, especially if you were to fire both barrels at once.",

While no longer suitable for modern tanks or aircraft, thinner skinned vehicles or drones are just as susceptible, as are any other 'smaller' threats.  Slow to reload, incredibly loud, and must be mounted to be fired.",
