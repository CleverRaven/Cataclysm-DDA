    "description": "A detachable magazine fed shotgun, mostly oriented towards overly enthusiastic civilians.  Featuring rails and a menancing black finish and furniture, this sort of shotgun doesn't really look like it has a sporting use.  Though such systems tend to not work well overall, the box magazine feed reduces the lengthy reloading times associated with shotguns.  These can be tuned to run somewhat reliably for competition use.",
