An 'assault rifle', it is capable of providing both accurate semi-automatic fire and bursts of automatic fire.

    "description": "The light machine gun is a formidable implement for suppressive fire, an important part of squad tactics.  Its belt feed allows for hundreds of rounds to be loaded, and its heavy components can withstand long bursts of fire.  While perhaps not as precise as a service rifle, a light machinegun does allow for a considerable amount of energy to be sent down range.  Slow to reload.",

The high pressures involved and questionable construction make for less than ideal durability and reliability, but this should still be a serviceable weapon, provided you can stay accurate with it.",

While almost as effective as a proper rifle, the wider variety of components and varying levels of maintenance make these less reliable than their military brethren.  These rifles are just as adequate for taking on anything smaller than large game, however.",
