this has taken me about eleven straight days so far.

I changed the code as absolutely little as I had to for this mod. (just added the function for the birch tree bark).
-does not overwrite any other items
-no outright cheat items, but some good items.
-fairly balanced, with immersive descriptions, and I've sort of added my own imagination to the cataclysms mythos.
-some humor, but not disruptively much.

--all items either have recipes in the pre-existing books, or are generated on the map, or both.
--all monsters are generated on the map correctly.

--Major features:
*airguns in 177 and 22 caliber and ammo.
*many small vehicle parts
*honeybees + beekeeping. --> immersive, not cheaty. (bonus:fireflies)

--unresolvable bug (feature for extra fun)
because of the way the bee swarms work, you might notice a message about disintegrating that was not moddable but i did what i could to make it humorous.

--contributions?
->fork me on github.  Cataclysm DDA / MysticXtheUnknown, or else, just email me your idea or contribution.

--my requests to devs for CDDA features:
1)make it so an immobile object can still have attacks e.g. "cant_walk" vs "immobile" (which prevents melee attacks and some special attacks). that way my stationary bee nests could spit out worker bees like a grenadier does his manhacks, but couldnt' walk around the map.
2)make it so plants can provide fruit in multiple seasons
3)make a tag for monsters that replaces the various default messages (death_message) (struck_message) (attacks_message), "successful_attack_message" etc.

--tools:
small water purifier
advanced flashlight
popover tray (for baking)
fishing net
fishing handline

--foods
french toast + deluxe version --> theres no good cataclysm without french toast.
deluxe hamburger helper -->vanilla supplimental
meatloaf --> the tasty kind
popovers (bread puddings)

--vehicle parts: (not generated on map, but craftable)
small kitchen unit (foldable)
superalloy folding frame
micro-fridge (foldable)
small controls (foldable)
small muffler (foldable)
dozer bucket (push over some trees why dont you?)
blue and green cloth wall (foldable)
micro-reactor
small and large atomic storage batteries + sturdy versions
medium electric engine - fills a gap in the vanilla game
atomic foot pedals - zoom!
atomic motor - only needs a trace battery charge to start up.
atomic headlight - reinforced headlight takes only trace battery charge to run.
tiny advanced solar panel - a folding solar panel for your four wheeler or electric bicycle.

bushing upgrade for airguns 
piston upgrade "
screws upgrade "
trigger upgrade "
spring upgrade "
airgun scope "

--containers
Bucket (activate to switch between liquid storage mode or hauling items while wearing on your person)

--armor:
advanced power armor hauling frame - more storage than vanilla.  craft from 2 power armor hauling rigs, so this is a late-late game item.
shield generator (can be worn with power armor) - reminiscent of out of this world.  flavor contributions appreciated.
(the shield generator can be turned on, then activated again for a heat-generating anti-radiation function.

--vehicles pregenerated:
survivor's bike - someone cobbled this together with advanced parts.

--"monsters"
small mutant scorpion - prefers to attack in groups.. not particularly aggressive.
giant scorpion - dangerous but not always agressive.  rare night.
wild queen honeybee - as an item and a monster. upgrades to growing hive.  Tiny
wild worker honeybee - as a monster.Tiny
wild honeybee swarm - a yellow # that spits out worker bees (it has very many)but they upgrade to a 0hp monster when the player is absent (they disintegrate), preventing excessive map clogging.  to disguise this you may get a peculiar message from time to time when nearing swarms but it's humorous.
wild growing honeybee hive. kill to get queen.  will eventually upgrade into a mature nest that yeilds honey.
wild honeybee hive - a mature hive, ready to harvest
firefly - you see them at night in the new england summer.

--"items"
bee skep (a house for bees to live in. use construction menu to place, if you have a queen in your inventory)
queen bee - to carry in your inventory and use later.
worker bee (this is not used ingame but is a placeholder so that the swarms can spit them out like a grenadier does his manhacks)

--terrain
(domestic)growing honeybee hive (yes, there are both monsters and terrain in this mod for the beekeeping
(domestic)honeybee hive (ready to harvest in autumn, you get about a pound of honey.  just wait for 1 year to get more honeycombs.)

--construction
*command "set up a honey bee hive" uses the bee skep you crafted and a queen bee to start a domestic hive. now you can harvest it once a year for some honey.

--immersion
I added a couple items here and there to add some immersion to locations.  (spoiler:)for instance, you can now find a combat knife rare drop in the schools, considering kids bring stuff like that to school.


Notes:
-atomic footpedal atomic headlight and motor: 
These items are great for small bicycles that need a headlight or motor but don't have a way to generate electricity (e.g. to be economical with weight).  These items are all foldable. these require 10 plutonium cells so they are mid-game-ish.  theyre great for carrying with you as you run around in a city, you can attach the atomic motor to a vehicle and drive away if there is a trace battery charge left in the subject vehicle.

anyway so these items are not perfect and may need rebalancing but i did my best.

not required:  if you modify/redistribute, would appreciate a mention in your credits.
