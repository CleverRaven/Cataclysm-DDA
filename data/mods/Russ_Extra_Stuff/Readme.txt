Notes:
-atomic footpedal atomic headlight and motor: 
These items are great for small bicycles that need a headlight or motor but don't have a way to generate electricity (e.g. to be economical with weight).  These items are all foldable. these require 10 plutonium cells so they are mid-game-ish.  theyre great for carrying with you as you run around in a city, you can attach the atomic motor to a vehicle and drive away if there is a trace battery charge left in the subject vehicle.

anyway so these items are not perfect and may need rebalancing.

this is an experimental mod.  Use/modify/redistribute to your satisfaction, just mention me in the credits.  Use github.
