## About
Dark Skies Ahead was largely born when my medieval partial conversion mod started hitting big roadblocks. Initially I was hesitant because I wasn't really jiving with sci-fi, but as time went on, I found myself becoming excited for a game where you survive the aftermath of a hostile alien invasion and the new regime that springs up afterwards.

## Terms
So we're all on the same page as you read through this:

- The Arrival: The few days of hostile alien activity, where they effectively rolled up any resistance and smoked it good. Chaotic and traumatizing.
 - The New Order: Colliqualism for the alien puppet government, taken from popular media and a propaganda newspaper article where the aliens mention themselves being a "new order". Sometimes shortened to just 'Order'.
 - Designated Living Zones (DLZ): Where the aliens took all the humans who surrendered to them. May or may not actually exist, may or may not be off-world even, may or may not be highly idealized.
 - The Frontier: The areas outside the DLZs. Highly desirable to the aliens as being where a bulk of the raw resources are.
 - Strays: People horribly mutated by alien bioweapons used during the Arrival. Hostile to the New Order and, by some extension other humans, but unable to really differentiate between simple survivors and the people that did this to them.

## Inspirations

### Half Life 2 (video game)
One of the first pieces of 'invasion and occupation' media I ever consumed. While I didn't take any particular inspiration from the Combine (the main villain of the game) that isn't seen in a more 'refined' sense in XCOM 2, I took some inspiration from elements like how the humans really never figured out what the aliens really called themselves (or, at least I sort of got the impression that 'Combine' was a human invented term) and the air of vast mystery that came with encountering their darker facilities/motivations.

### War of the Worlds (book)
Inspiration for the events of the Arrival, the atmosphere of having to flee your home in face of an unstoppable alien threat... as well as the 'emissaries', who are an obvious reference.

### XCOM 2 (video game)
An obvious one. XCOM 2 presents a world somewhat similar to Half Life 2's dystopia, but gussies it up a bit and honestly makes it a tad more realistic with the depiction of the guerrilla warfare likely needed to actually combat a threat so organized. The soldiers of XCOM obviously have a bit of an advantage, though. The idea of the cult-like New Order comes from here, as well as the concept of the Strays from The Lost. No doubt there will be more as time goes on.

## Colony (TV)
Another depiction of an alien occupation force working through a puppet government, somewhere in between XCOM 2 and Half Life 2. Key from here is the aliens picking out people they liked from pre-Arrival society, as well as cutting deals with the government/military/etc to entice them into going 'rogue' to have a smoother transitionary period and not kill everyone. No doubt I'll take more inspiration as I start on NPC questlines.


# Atmosphere and Game World

Much of the base assumptions don't differ from CDDA, and will doubtless change along with vanilla - things take place [current year + 1], in New England, and so forth. National conscience is largely categorized by unsteady relations with China and several devastating natural disasters, leading to the creation of the evac centers. Weather related catastrophes would lead to said shelters being quickly drained of palatable resources as the weather worsened, and they would not be restocked meaninfully by the time of the Arrival.

CBMs and mutations have been removed, but will be re-added as extensions of alien technology.

Ultimately, by their own efforts alone, the player will probably be seen as a speed bump to the aliens at best. With some help, they might even be able to make something of a dent, with some luck as well, they can slow down the plans of the Order enough that they won't have to worry about them for weeks at a time.


## The New Order

 - Their major theme is: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" (Clarke's Third Law) and have what I describe as a 'techcult' aesthetic, using a mix of psionics and high technology mixed with medieval aesthetics. 
 - The aliens of Dark Skies above are to invoke a sensation of dread. They are smart and do not hold their punches, with the only saving grace being that the player has not yet made themself enough of a nuisance to warrant high force responses. They can be found patroling the Frontier and other hardpoints, and things won't get any easier.
 - Alien technology is not easy to use, and often won't react to a survivor's desires at all - however, they can stripped down and jury-rigged into new tools. Obviously this takes inspiration to Aftershock's planned crafting system!
 - Have a hierarchy: mind controlled and partially mutated humans serve as the bottom tier, more numerous but generally weak health and minor psionics, upper tiers are more and more alien who can cast more psionics.


## Strays

 - Numerous but fairly weak and slow, but become faster over time.
 - Living, breathing humans heavily mutated by an alien bioweapons.
 - Regenerate - reason for their reviving. Burning overpowers this - burnt strays do not revive, but do become slightly more dangerous.
 - Mutations revolve around slowly shedding their humanity to become 'apex predators'.
 - Will eventually be outcompeted by any New Order units in the area.
