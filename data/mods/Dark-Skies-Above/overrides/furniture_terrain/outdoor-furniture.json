    "description": "An invasive species brought to Earth by the invaders and found it quite to its liking.  It spiny, writhing fronds make it look more like a jungle bush than a conventional poppy except for its red petals, but is named after such due to its similar medicinal properties.  It exudes a potent, sleep inducing aroma."
