    "description": "A popular, fancy smartphone.  Capable of making photos due to integrated camera and illuminating an area as per its flashlight app, assuming it has enough charge.  The smartphone also has a clock app that includes an alarm.  Runs on a small, proprietary power cell that needs a specialized charger.  That is to say, is quite difficult to recharge post-Cataclysm.",
