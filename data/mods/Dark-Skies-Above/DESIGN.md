# Dark Skies Above

This document is intended to not only guide new potential contributors, but also help get my own thoughts on how the game will progress in text. Assume spoilers beyond this point.

Mechanically, Dark Skies Above began as a project to demonstrate how you can push the game engine to present different stories. Dark Skies itself focuses around the aftermath of a successful alien invasion, the survival of those unincorporated by the new government, and resistance. Unlike the base game, a narrative arc is assumed: the player will want find a way to make occupation of Earth too costly for the aliens to continue, or die trying. This is, of course, by no means an "easy" or "short" process, nor is it necessarily a requirement. This is done largely to compensate for the fact that Dark Skies does not play well with other mods or some aspects of active development, thus needing a tighter experience.

There are two major literary conflicts portrayed by the mod that new content can be guided by. The first is person vs. environment, as the aliens (referred to as "the Order" by survivors throughout the game) introduce bioengineered species and terraforming engines to make the planet more hospitable for them (and in the process, make human survivors more reliant on them for survival). The second is person vs. person, as the player struggles against the forces of the Order to both resist occupation and to survive as said forces are augmented to in turn better counter human resistance.

# Contributing

Since Dark Skies is distributed with the base game, contributions are welcome. If you have any questions, you can contact me on Discord via `@ephemeral_storyteller` through the offical developer or official community severs.

# Content

Summarized below are the rough design directions currently intended.


## The Player

The player is a survivor of not only the initial invasion, often termed "the Arrival", but also the ensuing alien victory and roundup of most surviving humans into "designated living zones" - refurbished urban centers. They might be very able, or simply very lucky. Outside of very specific starts, they do not know much about the invaders or the resistance efforts and learn as they go, though eventually a start as a resistance member would be ideal as a sort of jump-start into the narrative arc. Tentatively, players will also be able to select "RP traits" at character creation that will give them some optional interactions with NPCs in the world. These probably won't have significant mechanical benefits, but hopefully will give the player a stronger sense of place in the world.


## The Resistance and the Narrative

Small pockets of resistance have sprung up, largely sticking to the forests or hidden bunkers that will evade notice. They are part of a larger overall network that the player can join and do missions for. Ideally these will only appear after a few months and gradually build up, though the game doesn't quite work like this (yet) and will likely require some dirty tricks using NPC quests. That aside: the rebels are the primary drivers of the "story", providing the player with the resources needed to take on the Order. Without them, the player will mostly perform comparatively small-time raids, lacking the necessary logistics to, say, sufficiently distract the main garrison of a larger facility. 


## Other NPCs

Many more humans survived the Arrival and still yet remain free than survived the events of the Cataclysm. Bandits and looters are more common, and largely are concerned only with their own survival rather than the lofty ideas of the rebels.


## The Order

The alien forces have never particularly identified themselves to humanity, nor should the name of their civilization ever be known. The term "the Order" comes from a speech given by their proxies, referring to themselves as the "new order", and the term largely stuck. They view humanity as a resource at best, and an obstacle to be dealt with at worst. This is to say that they harbor no special ill, but will come down hard on anything disrupting their operations.

The technology of their main forces are sufficiently advanced enough to defeat what humans can field head on, and indeed sometimes their abilities even seem like magic. Their technology has a vaguely religious or holy feel to it, with lots of white, gold, and black color scheme. Their dedicated units have sleek and majestic designs (in stark contrast to their brutality), indicating that the Order has a culture of their own and take pride in design. It is also clear that they are somewhat overconfident in their relative superiority. Humanity still outnumbers them significantly, and fueling and repairing their more advanced technology requires a sophisticated chain of supply. That said: time is not on the side of humans, as more efficient designs are developed in order to protect their assets, deny resources to rebels, and otherwise terminate troublesome entities.


## Other Aliens

There is potential for other intelligent alien species to have a place on Earth post-Arrival. Their numbers would be quite limited, but scavengers who might be receptive to trade are quite possible.


## Alien Technology

Freshly looted off of a corpse alien technology is not usable by humans, but there are ways around this. Human usable alien tech is broadly split into two categories: "homebrew" and "cracked". These categories are pretty much purely for contributors and have no real place in game.

"Homebrew" is everything crudely assembled out of alien parts that produce effects that weren't perhaps intended by the aliens, but useful to humans none-the-less. Bombs, noisemakers, one-shot laser cannons, and the like are all examples of this. These items are strictly inferior to proper alien tech, but at least somewhat better than items of purely Earth manufacture, if somewhat more temperamental. These items can be made with the help of some human tools (welders, screwdrivers, etc) and are unlocked by completing a recipe that combines several alien components, which in turn generates a recipe "book" called "tinkering notes". Creating "tinkering notes" requires some time investment and prior skill in Earth tech.

"Cracked" items are pieces of alien gear that have been discretely modified to allow human usage, like dedicated grenades, guns, and armor. Unlocking these recipes and executing them requires a similar tinkering process and dedicated alien tools, which are installed in alien outposts. Cracked alien tech provide great boons with fairly minimal drawbacks, but are somewhat difficult to maintain (loss of charge and difficult to repair in particular), due to Earth innately lacking infrastructure to keep them in top shape.
