Local officials could not be reached for comment, despite the mine being Saritania's primary industry.  An anonymous but credible source did contact our offices, claiming that the Saritania Mine was in fact an underground military facility, and that the disaster was a cover-up for a failed experiment.  These allegations were not addressed by officials."
