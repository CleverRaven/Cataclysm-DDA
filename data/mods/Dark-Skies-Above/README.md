# Dark Skies Above
A partial conversion mod for Cataclysm: DDA, taking inspiration from XCOM 2, Half Life 2, the movie Skyline (not the sequel) and similar 'alien invasion' media to present a brutal game of survival against an alien expeditionary force. 

# Takeaway Features
In short, this Dark Skies is much much more difficult than vanilla DDA, and recommended for players who have some experience under their belt. 

 - Many more people were twisted into hostile mutants by alien bioweapons, now called Strays. They are stronger than a vanilla zombie, but there come in smaller groups, usually, and have a few nasty variants.
 - Alien soldiers occupy high-value targets and have deployed to the streets in order to reclaim the cities for resources and neutralize threats. They each have uniquely debilitating psionic effects, a powerful melee weapon and an insidious dart gun. 
 - Invasive alien species prowl the wilderness, some hostile some are not. 
 - If you survive long enough, you may even see the Xenoid's emissaries to humanity.

# Meta
This is NOT a total conversion mod, I'll strive to make Dark Skies Above work as friendly with other mods as possible, and will try to maintain tileset support based off UndeadPeople tileset. I intend for this mod to challenge you as much as possible and won't pull any punches, this mod is people who want a crazy challenge and/or radical change to the base game. Having said that I really don't have any idea what I'm doing so keep that in mind before complaining. The original design document is included with the mod, put the specifics may not be included and should be considered apocryphal as far as future features.
