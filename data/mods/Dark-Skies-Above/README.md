# Dark Skies Above
A partial conversion mod for Cataclysm: DDA, taking inspiration from XCOM 2, Half Life 2, the movie Skyline (not the sequel) and similar 'alien invasion' media to present a brutal game of survival against an alien expeditionary force. 

# Takeaway Features
In short, this Dark Skies is much more difficult than vanilla DDA, and recommended for players who have some experience under their belt. 

 - Many more people were twisted into hostile mutants by alien bioweapons, now called Strays. They are stronger than a vanilla zombie, but there come in smaller groups, usually, and have a few nasty variants.
 - Alien soldiers occupy high-value targets and have deployed to the streets in order to reclaim the cities for resources and neutralize threats. They each have uniquely debilitating psionic effects, a powerful melee weapon and an insidious dart gun. 
 - Invasive alien species prowl the wilderness, some hostile some are not. 
 - If you survive long enough, you may even see the Xenoid's emissaries to humanity.
