# Design Document SPOILERS AHEAD
The core idea of DinoMod is this: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithDinosaurs
The purpose of this mod is to make Cataclysm a more fun game to play and develop for, showing off new mechanics and bringing life to parts of the game that aren't as well-developed.

# What belongs in DinoMod?
Dinosaurs and content based around dinosaurs that for whatever reason can't just go into the vanilla game.

# Realism vs. Fun
There is more space in mods for fun. In general the vanilla living dinos should be as realistic as possible to the science we know but the zombie, CBM, and fungal dinos can go anywhere as long as it's fun.

# Adding, replacing, removing
This mod is about adding content. In general it should have as light a touch on the vanilla game as possible. This helps us keep it working by itself and with other mods.

# How to contribute
This mod is distributed with the base game, so any content contributed will have to be submitted to the Github site. You can talk with the mod maintainers about your ideas on Discord.
