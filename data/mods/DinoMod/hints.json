    "I've seen some big dinosaurs out there.  I know that should be scary, but all I felt was hungry.",
    "I think those little dinosaurs are kind of cute, like a cat kind of.  Do you think they eat cat food?",
    "Dinosaurs are a bow hunter's best friend.  Feathers forever!",
    "A buddy of mine wandered close to the swamps and was eaten by a T-Rex, a big lizard.  I'd be careful unless you have a gun and plenty of ammo.",
    "I hear the zombies have been in the swamps.  Bad news if they bite a dinosaur before it bites them.",
    "I know there aren't alligators in the sewer, but I heard there was some kind of big lizard down there.  Probably not a good idea to check.",
    "Some of those big dinosaurs seem halfway all right.  I bet if you fed them something nice and gave them a pet you could ride them like a pony.  Or maybe they'd eat you instead.",
    "One time I found a strange egg out in the woods.  It was probably a dinosaur, but I cooked it and it was pretty good!"
