Or staircase.  It is not important, I mean to say that people love who they love, and the dinosaur, she does the same, and there is no shame in what two people or dinosaurs do in the escalier.  Alonso does not judge you.  You do you.  And maybe Alonso as well when you are done with the you doing.",
