You're going to want to get together a real butcher setup, hooks and all, rig up a way to keep the meat cold or even better frozen, and figure out some way to make it last longer.  Could do jerky, maybe get a canning operation going.  The main thing is to work fast before it goes bad.  Hey, I know a pretty good cook who could help with that.  No, she's dead.  I'm here though.",
