Then it's time to hide on the roof for a while until they calm down.  I gave one some cattle feed and they seemed to like it fine, let me pet it and followed me around some. I bet you could tame them if they're young, maybe even some of the grown ones. A man came out here a while ago saying they were coming, that it was their time and we needed to get with them or get out of the way.  The man said I should follow him to the Swamper church, but I'm too busy here.  A whole lot of people went with him though.",
