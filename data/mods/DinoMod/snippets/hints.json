      "I've seen some big dinosaurs out there.  I know that should be scary, but all I felt was hungry.",
      "I think those little dinosaurs are kind of cute, like a cat kind of.  Do you think they eat cat food?",
      "Dinosaurs are a bow hunter's best friend.  Feathers forever!",
      "I saw one of those feathered dinosaurs up close and it had these beautiful soft downy feathers under the big ones.  I bet if you could pluck one you could make a nice dino feather mattress.",
      "Those big dinosaurs make a big mess.  If only there was some way to harness the power of those poops for the uplift of all mankind.  Maybe a renewable energy source, or a construction material, or super dino fertilizer",
      "A buddy of mine wandered close to the swamps and was eaten by a T-Rex, a big lizard.  I'd be careful unless you have a gun and plenty of ammo.",
      "I hear the zombies have been in the swamps.  Bad news if they bite a dinosaur before it bites them.",
      "I know there aren't alligators in the sewer, but I heard there was some kind of big lizard down there.  Probably not a good idea to check.",
      "Some of those big dinosaurs seem halfway all right.  I bet if you fed them something nice and gave them a pet you could ride them like a pony.  Or maybe they'd eat you instead.",
      "I saw something with a large fin in the water.  It was the size of a whale and gave me a menacing feeling.  I'm gonna think twice before going back there.",
      "One time I found a strange egg out in the woods.  It was probably a dinosaur, but I cooked it and it was pretty good!",
      "One time I found a giant egg out in the woods.  I ate it raw all at once and then got sick all over.  Maybe I should have cooked it and eaten it bit by bit?",
      "I got a bunch of these big lizards to follow me around and it was great and then they smashed up the place I was staying and then a bunch of other places I wanted to set up camp in.  Maybe I should have tied them down?"
