# Cataclysm-DDA-Touhou-Mod
This is a fork of Taberone's [Touhou Professions](https://github.com/Taberone/Cataclysm-DDA-Touhou-Mod) mod.

**The mod's folder goes in /data/mods/**.  Last updated for game version: 2022-12-24 experimental.

## About the mod
This mod adds Touhou Project characters as professions.  Each character (2hu) has custom spells, abilities, clothing, martial arts, traits (mutations), and more.  To pick any of the 2hus, you have to select the **Touhou Mod** scenario when creating a new character.


## 2hus
* **Aya Shameimaru:** Uses wind spells.  The earnest, most pure, fastest Tengu reporter is always on the look of interesting news.
* **Fujiwara no Mokou:** Uses fire spells.  Fights with a custom martial art that increases her damage over time, while also making her more vulnerable.  Death has no meaning to her.
* **Hong Meiling:** Uses qi.  Fights using a special form of Tai Chi focused on defense, with windows of opportunity after blocking attacks.  Nap time can't come soon enough.
* **Iku Nagae:** Uses electric spells.  Fights by whipping and shocking enemies to death, while dancing on the battlefield.
* **Reisen:** Uses a mysterious ability.  Recently conscripted into the Lunarian Defence Corps, fights aided by her service Lunarian rifle and basic military training.  She's trying her best!
* **Reisen Udongein Inaba:** Uses wavelength manipulation.  Former member of the Elite Lunarian Defence Corps, proficient with firearms and skilled in special operations.  Starts with a Lunarian tech pistol.
* **Remilia Scarlet:** Uses Red Magic.  The charismatic vampire leader of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, nothing can oppose her when she's serious.
* **Rin Kaenbyou :** Uses destructive fire spells and calls forth Vengeful spirits to assist her in battle.  Collects corpses with her wooden wheelbarrow.
* **Sakuya Izayoi:** Uses time manipulation.  Fights by elegantly throwing knives, then cleaning it all perfectly afterwards.
* **Seiga Kaku:** Uses wicked spells and can pass through walls.  Fights without care for human life or norms, all while forcing "collateral damage" victims back to life to fight for her.
* **Tenshi Hinanawi:** Uses earth spells.  Very resistant to physical damage, very susceptible to boredom, she wields the Sword of Hisou and fights with a martial art focused on critical attacks over anything else.
* **Utsuho Reiuji:** Uses nuclear spells.  She's half Hell Raven, half sun god, half pet, wholly awesome.
* **Youmu Konpaku:** Uses sword techniques.  Also trained in gardening, she wields Roukanken and Hakurouken, two Youkai katana capable of cutting anything!


## New mechanics
* Auras.  Sakuya and Udongein have "aura" type abilities, each with different passive effects as long as they're active.  These are toggled by casting specific spells.
* Blood thirst.  Remi now has to consume blood (or human flesh, with less effectiveness) in any shape or form, in order to keep the thirst at bay.
* Immortality (for Mokou).  She resurrects after dying, immediately restoring her body.  She can die as many times as she wants, but there's a soft cap relative to how many times she has died in a period of time, plus a small-ish pain debuff that ramps up, to discourage savescumming.
* Wings.  Aya, Remi and Utsuho can now "fly" (read: hover) over over ledges and open spaces, consuming stamina until they're tired enough.  This is done by activating a mutation (View/active mutations key).
* Youkai form toggle.  Kaenbyou and Remi can now switch between their human and youkai forms, each having different effects.  This is done by activating a mutation (View/active mutations key).


## Clothing
Every 2hu has their own custom set of clothing.  Not all are just cosmetics changes.


## Minor milestones
Relatively easy things to add, not in order:
* More 2hus: Nitori and Yamame are still not playable.  I want to add Kasen and maybe Flandre too.
* Visual effects: Can it be done with fields? For example, when Youmu dashes, cherry petals appear on the path.
* Vehicles: Make an engine that can use corpses as fuel.
* Balance: CDDA is a roguelike, but the mod feels RPG-ish at times.


## Major milestones
Relatively hard or complex things to add, not in order:
* Even MORE 2hus.
* Things that are currently hardcoded, like new damage types, new resources (plus a visual indicator), new kind of spells (like using proyectiles, different shape, being active at a location, etc.), more mechanics, etc.
* Spellcards?


## Known bugs
* Mokou's resurrection moves her 3 tiles to the right, every time she revives. I have no idea how or why this happens; this is potentially very very bad for the player.
