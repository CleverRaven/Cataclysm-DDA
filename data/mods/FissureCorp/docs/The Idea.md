* Scientist, tasked with exploring a dead cataclysmic world.
* Work a corporation / organization that is shadowy, though human.
* The way you interact with this dead world, genetically engineered soldiers.
* Your soldier, expected to hunt down materials, find fallen other soldiers w. caches, explore, map the planet etc.

### TLDR
Sky Islands (Tarkov, Mauraders, Anomaly) + DDA Crafting Management (with the scientist) but as a total conversion.



### Core Systems
* [[#The Character]]
* More nuanced, and more abstracted [[#Melee]], compared with DDA. 
* [[#Guns]] still exist. Should be powerful, usable in [[#Melee]], 
* [[#The enemies]]
* [[#Research]]
* [[#Subsystems]]
* [[#The world]]

### The Character
* Persistent character, Scientist (build skills, proficiencies, need food / water etc.)
* Transient character who are your combat monkeys. Not too worried about their death, just means you can go out again.
* Transient character can be modified with [[#Research]] stuff like mutation and cybernetics, as well as new skills.
* Basically you get to build a template character (or potentially more) that a copy is made of when you go out into the world.

### Melee
Robust combination of current state, DDA martial arts, and new choice system.
* Tight number of melee weapons.
* On attack, you get to choose 1 of X techniques out of all your martial arts (selected randomly).
* Techniques will be very selective, based on a "tags" system.
* Tags will be stuff like "close", "far", "downed", "stunned", "grabbing", "off balance", "recovering". 
* So for example, your character could potentially execute enemies that are downed. But after weapon swapping potentially enemies could have an attack to knock your weapon from your hand (or at least try).
* **No Moves counted** combat happens evenly as you and your opponents try to harm each other.

### Guns
* Have to small collection of Sci-Fi grade weapons.
	* Laser
	* SP
	* Gauss
	* Others (chemical)
* Very moddable, compared with core DDA.
* Exchangeable mechanisms, barrels, mags, devices / optics, stocks, etc.
* Different mods, weapons etc. will be [[#Research]]

### The enemies
* Very few enemies, a single entity should be a challenge itself.
* Groups should be very lethal / scary as they apply more tags / disruption.
* Strange distorted creatures.
* Very few enemy types base, with lots of personality / moves. 
* But, I want enemy templates, so a specific base enemy could spawn "Big", or "electric" or "extra fast". Similar to the current artifact system.

### The world
* Megacity, destroyed, lots of craters, partially destroyed buildings etc.
* Potentially biomes, different effected areas with different rewards/enemy types.
* Only able to exist on the surface for a few hours. Basically at night the world gets really bad and your character JUST dies (though maybe let them play it out). Can potentially recover lost items though on next expedition.
* Abstract a lot of items and "junk" as junk. Don't need everything to exist it can just be rusted bits and bobs. 
* Game has a "game director" dictates monster spawns, quests, anomalies etc.


### Research
As you explore, bring back material etc. you'll get funding with the org. Can use this funding, to buy into projects with the rest of the org.

Split into a few separate categories.
* Mutagenics (monster)
* Robotics (machine)
* Weapons (guns and melee)
* Materials (armour)
* [[#Subsystems]]

### Subsystems
In true sci-fi fashion your gear will be your lifeline. 
Enviro Suit will have a generator (which can be upgraded) which as things use power, will generate heat.
So you'll have:
* Passive heat, take a percentage of your generator.
* Heat spikes which use generator temporarily and then dissipate.

> So a laser weapon when fired could eat 12% of your heat, which dissipates at 2% per second. 

> But NVG could have a passive heat of 10% so they lock your minimum heat at 10%

This will tie into cybernetics as well.

#### The Suit
Your character isn't going to have standard bp's. Instead each of their BPs is actually include a base layer enviro suit. Once injuries as a system exists, can have cool interactions like having to duct tape holes in your suit.


### Quests
Find dead soldier, could have gear better / different then yours + could harvest for genetic material to mutate your soldier. 

### Genetic Memory
Perk / Rogue Lite system where your character gets better over time (on top of progressing your scientist and upgrading your soldier) where stuff they do / learn in the field can be saved as perks
* new martial arts moves for weapon classes
* extra HP
* Stam
* IDK what else
