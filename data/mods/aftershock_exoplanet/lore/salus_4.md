Aftershock takes place in a desolate exoplanet named Salus IV at the very edges of the Orion arm. 

The planet is just outside the system's habitable zone, with average temperatures below  what's safe for unprotected humans.

The terrain is glacial, massive sheets of ice are separated by deep fissures and canyons. Under the ice, massive tunnels, created by unknown forces, provide access to veins of ore.

Sufficient mineral wealth exists to make mining operations profitable, but the harsh cold and remote location means large mining corporations have passed Salus IV over, leaving it to a loose collection of independent mining operations.

Without a significant manufacturing base, colonists and miners rely on interplanetary trade for most supplies, particularly good to supplement the limited amounts grown in artificial biospheres.
