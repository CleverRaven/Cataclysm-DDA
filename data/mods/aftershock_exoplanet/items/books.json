    "description": "Welcome to Frozen Hell, an unofficial history of Salus IV by Bette Lapin.  Salus IV was founded in the early days of the Hyperspace Era as a joint venture between Mercurial Genomics and a Soviet Design Bureau.  At its height several hundred years ago Salus IV had just over 110 million citizens (including both uplifts and humans). However, that population had begun to decline even before the Discontinuity as people migrated to planets that, while more hostile to life during the earliest colonization phases than Salus IV, were much simpler to terraform into a place more enjoyable by human and uplift citizens.",

    "description": "Even during the Discontinuity Salus IV's population continued to drop as there were easier places to live even in the Salus system - from honeycombed asteroid habitats to domed cities with gorgeous views.  Mercurial Genomics was an early member of the nascent post-Discontinuity government efforts.  As a result of this membership, they have successfully reclaimed Salus IV in the court system set up by ESCA.  The Whately family, which runs Mercurial Genomics, began leasing development and exploitation permits and allows the establishment of minor UICA outposts within Salus IV.  There is an official citizen count of less than twenty thousand sentient beings, albeit mostly in orbit.  It is believed, however, that there are at least that many non-citizen sentients spread amongst squatter, smuggler, pirate, and feral uplift communities.",

    "description": "The Salus system is what is called a hinge system for the new FTL travels.  This system contains a number of easy exit points to star systems that have no other easy way to travel to each other than through a series of systems with low to zero civilization in them.  Salus has several interstellar refueling points.  These stations are often blind to each other as the planets and other objects rotate around the sun.  Mercurial seems to have no interest in managing or protecting the traffic that flows through the Salus system or in neighboring systems beyond the bare minimum effort required by UICA.  As a result of this neglect; victims of pirate attacks, engine failure and other critical issues regularly limp to whatever safety they can find in the Salus system.  Unfortunately for many of them they will crash land on Salus IV where there are few regular shuttles between its scattered ports and the outside universe.  As the locals are fond of saying 'Getting to Salus IV is hard, getting off may be impossible'.",
