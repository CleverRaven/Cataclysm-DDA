The spread of the shot doesn't just increase your chances to have a projectile hit, it also causes a much larger wound, greatly increasing lethality.  It does struggle with range, and against body armor.",

Not as lethal as buckshot in certain ranges, but much more accurate and with a longer range, and is more effective against armor.",

The loss in mass in order to accommodate an explosive give it much less impact force compared to traditional ammunition.  The relatively small size of the slug can only accommodate a limited amount of explosives, resulting in a fairly underwhelming explosion.  These traits make it a utility tool for damaging barriers and disrupting other explosive devices, rather than something for anti-personnel use.",
