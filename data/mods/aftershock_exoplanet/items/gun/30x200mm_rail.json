    "description": "When the design board first convened, it was decided that the Rectifier would be designed with two considerations: first, that it should be capable of launching a 2kg anti-armor penetrator at no less than 3,000 m/s, and second, that it would be mounted in spacecraft of at least 40 tons.  Turns out Gibson's engineers truly are excellent and you can rip out the whole electromagnetic accelerator assembly, strap it to a tripod with a UPS battery and a smart scope and have yourself one hell of a long-range anti-materiel rifle.  The recoil is brutal, the stopping power is unmatched, the residual heat will melt your face off.",
