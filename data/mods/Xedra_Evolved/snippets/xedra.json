At this time, we have not been able to locate the missing individuals or definitively establish the involvement of fae-class cryptids.  However, we are actively pursuing all leads and are dedicating significant resources to this investigation.  /nRecommendation: Based on our findings to date, we recommend that the area be designated as a high-risk zone for fae cryptid activity.  We urge all residents to exercise caution and report any suspicious activity to the authorities.  Additionally, we recommend that public awareness campaigns be initiated to educate the public about the potential dangers of fae cryptids and how to avoid potential conflicts.

He'd been drinking and walking his goat late one night and as he neared the edge of the wetlands he heard strange music and multicoloured lights.  He suspected one of his neighbors who's property adjoined the bog of throwing a party but after walking around the edges he couldn't figure out how to get through the various streams and ponds to get to it.  Finally at some point, he remembered stories his grandparents had told about people going missing in the bogs and decided to go home and call the police.  The police passed it on to the Border Patrol who investigated for dimensional spillage.  While they were unable to find any cryptids or artifacts at the bogs, they measured a weakness in reality that suggests that the stories might have basis in fact.  Border Patrol left emergency contact information with the local police in the event of any future incursions."
