I go out into the forest and I sit and pretty soon there's some bugs crawling on me or my back itches or I get a cramp in my leg and it breaks my concentration.  I've gotten pretty used to the heartvines moving, that's not the problem, it's the *other* stuff I can't get past.\n\nIt's weird, right?  You'd think that having a plant in my blood would be all I can think about but I got used to it in a week.  ̶A̶n̶y̶t̶h̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶i̶f̶ ̶I̶ ̶c̶a̶n̶  No, not yet.  I have to find the thing that did it, then I'll write it all down.  Now I just have to stop getting those cricks in my neck when I'm looking up through the leaves."

Day 19: 3L donated blood provided.\n\nWe've been doing this for who knows how long and we still don't understand basic principles like \"How much do we get out based on what we put in?\"    Animal blood doesn't work, though, that's a constant.  We've tried cows, sheep, dogs, cats, pigs, rats, bats, everything we could think of and it just spat it all out.  Only human blood will do.\n\nI don't know why the elders allow this.  All the leeches need to die."

They cross running water without problem.  One thing that does work is pulling them with our heartvines out into the sun.  The Elder Druid's have told the story of how Sol Invictus takes vengeance upon all vampires in punishment for a group of vampires violating his shrine and its supplicants during the Roman Republic.  Before that you needed to either annihilate the body or drain the blood of a vampire until it died.  Both methods still work, but sunlight is safer and easier."

They seem to have little to no animosity against humanity but their sacrifice is made necessary by their refusal to act.  If they won't use their powers to destroy the vampires, we will."
