      "You have bad dreams.",
      "You dreams are terrifying.",
      "You dream of odd creatures circling you.",
      "You feel like a demon under your bed just brushed your hand.",
      "You heart races like you just came face to face with a bogeyman.",
      "Panic seizes you suddenly with no discernible reason.",
      "A torrent of cold sweat starts running down your back.",
      "You think not sleeping could be the preferable option right now.",
      "You are afraid.",
      "You feel like terrifying creatures are surrounding you.",
      "In your dream, an infinitely hot wind scorches your face until nothing but charred bone remains.",
      "In your dream, enormous gravity crushes you against the ground until your bones are reduced to fine dust.",
      "In your dream, a strong wind lifts you up into the sky only to then let you plummet to your death.",
      "In your dream, you are hunted by inhuman giants.",
      "In your dream, you are the toy of an unspeakable power.",
      "In your dream, no one is willing to help you.",
      "In your dream, you feel like you were shot in the face with a rifle.",
      "In your dream, you feel as if you are no better than the shambling dead.",
      "In your dream, you feel it might be better to be dead than existing in constant agony.",
      "In your dream, you have no one to ask for help.",
      "In your dream, the world has lost all its colors and you feel it slowly leeching yours.",
      "In your dream, the world is pitch black yet you feel something is in the dark pursuing you."
