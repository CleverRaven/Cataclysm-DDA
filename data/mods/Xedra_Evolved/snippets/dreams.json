      "You dream of odd creatures circling you.",
      "You feel like a demon under your bed just brushed your hand.",
      "You heart races like you just came face to face with a bogeyman.",
      "Panic seizes you suddenly with no discernible reason.",

      "You think not sleeping could be the preferable option right now.",
      "You are afraid.",
      "You feel like terrifying creatures are surrounding you.",

      "in your dream, you feel like you were shot in the face with a rifle.",
      "In your dream, you experience such agony than you are no better than dead.",
      "In your dream, you feel it might be better to be dead than suffer so much.",
      "In your dream, you have no one to ask help from.",
      "In your dream, the world has lost all its colors and you feel it slowly leeching yours.",
      "In your dream, the world is pitch black yet you feel something is in the dark pursuing you."
