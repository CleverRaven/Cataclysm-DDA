Preparation is key for these types of thaumaturgic assets and without being properly prepared for what they face they can be no more threatening than your average citizen.  Conversely we have found that more users of this type of magick retain their powers on Cradle-Earth than any other type than superhumans."

This reaction may seem extreme but any planet that develops superhuman attributes such as strength and endurance is at risk of also developing superintelligent, superperceptive individuals.  We are titling this hypothetical superhuman type as Sphinxes because Sphinxes eat the people who are less intelligent than themselves.  These individuals could potentially identify our presence on their dimension through variables we cannot even comprehend.  Whether our morality viewed them as good or evil would be irrevalent as we have no defense against this type of cultural/intellectual domination."

High energy refers to the amount of various radiations emanating from unknown sources that provide an equivalent amount of energy to multiple Sols.  This has resulted in an ecosystem where predation shouldn't need to exist but does.  Every creature we dissected appears to absorb tens of thousands of calories worth of ambient radiation every cycle.  Our observations over time showed that despite this abundance of energy, every lifeform we encountered also had a predation cycle they would undergo in which they prey on one or more of the other shadow creatures."

It spoke to them in English with a mishmash of accents, (later identifed as accents belonging to teams that had deployed to UMB-16) and that it was authorized to negotiate our presence in it's home dimension.  A return location and date were set and all teams were withdrawn and planned missions for before that date were scrapped.  Debate at the highest levels raged."
