    "description": "This CBM uses a rudimentary AI and chips at strategic points along the central nervous system to keep the body running and fighting after death.  This allows resuscitation, sometimes with extraordinary measures, but during this time the body will continue to bleed and take more damage and the most common outcome is still death.  However, if this fires and then within the next ten days you die again it will prevent even supernatural resuscitation."
