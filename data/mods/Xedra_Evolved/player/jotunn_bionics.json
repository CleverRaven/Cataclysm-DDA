    "description": "A pristine chassis for Exodii combat units collaquially referred to on this Earth as Jotunn.  A requirement for many heavy weapons that cannot be mounted on a standard bionic chassis or unaugmented body.  Impossible to salvage from a corpse post-installation, these units are manufactured sparingly by most Exodii nodes.  Installing this CBM will drastically alter the chakras, meridians, mystical pathways, soul, whatever thing inside of a person that allows them to use magick.  It will remove your magickal abilities or if you are irreversibly supernatural, fail to install.",
