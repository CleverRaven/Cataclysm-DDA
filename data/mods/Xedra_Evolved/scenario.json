Snow covers the ground, the sun has set, you are freezing cold, and the knife is still stuck in your torso.  However, you've gained a dramatic new sense of time, and what is definitely the beginning of the ability to manipulate it.  Even beyond the knife and the winter you never thought you'd have to prepare for, your new powers tell you that there is much more wrong with you than is immediately apparent.
