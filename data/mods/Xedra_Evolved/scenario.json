Eventually, something caught up, and as your fellows started turning into frozen statues you ran straight into what should have been open air.  The pain of that impact was nothing compared to the knife you suddenly found stabbed into your torso.  The most you saw of your attacker was a quick blur before everything suddenly changed.  Snow covers the ground, the sun has set, you are freezing cold, and the knife is still stuck in your torso.  However, you've gained a dramatic new sense of time, and what is definitely the beginning of the ability to manipulate it.  Even beyond the knife and the winter you never thought you'd have to prepare for, your new powers tell you that there is much more wrong with you than is immediately apparent.  Hopefully you can use your skills and powers to survive both your new condition and every other horror of the Cataclysm.",
