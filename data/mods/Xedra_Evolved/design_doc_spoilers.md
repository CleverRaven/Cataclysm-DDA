## Vampires

Xedra Evolved vampires are not walking corpses who drink the blood of the living. At least, not at first. Vampirism is a progressive disease and many sufferers are more alive than they are dead. While they can drink blood and derive power from it, they still need to eat, drink, and sleep just like mortals do. Becoming an actual undead monster requires a conscious decision on the part of the nascent vampire and can only be accomplished by committing heinous crimes (at the time of this writing, murdering a dear and trusting friend). Actual vampires are monsters without exception. 

Vampires have existed for a long time on the Earth of Xedra Evolved, and on some--though not all--extradimensional Earths as well. It is possible that humanity's first steps into agriculture and gathering into stationary cities were encouraged by vampires, so that they would have an easier time maintaining their herds. They use their `renfields`, brainwashed mortal agents, to manipulate human society and keep them safe from those who would destroy them. 

Vampires require human blood, or the blood of human-like species. They cannot survive on animal blood, so they are forced to prey on fellow sapients to survive. They also cannot drink vampire blood (though see below), becuase vampires have enough control over their own blood to prevent another from drinking it. A vampire who does not use any of their powers (called Blood Arts) is capable of surviving for quite a long time without needing to feed. 

### Blood Arts

Blood Arts is the term for vampires special abilities. With then, vampires can become stronger, faster, more resilient, have better senses, hypnotize or charm their prey, and eventually turn into wolf, bat, or mist.  More powerful vampires can also control darkness and shadows. The balance point for bLood arts is intentionally set so that a vampires who uses several of them will either have to feed soon after to avoid the `withering` (the status penalties that come from being low on blood), or will have to gorge beforehand and become `blood_quenched` in order to have enough blood to use all the Blood Arts they want during combat.

Principles of Blood Arts:
- Blood Arts cost blood. Any secondary costs (mana, stamina, sleepiness, etc) are unnecessary. Use of their powers should require vampires to drink more blood.
- Blood Arts should be "vampire-y" in theme and scope, with some latitude for interpretation. Creating tactile illusionary beasts that can harm the vampire's enemies is out, but creating animate shadows that can harm the vampire's enemies but die in light, or clouding their enemy's mind so they perceive a group of wolves approaching them, would both be acceptable.
- Blood Arts that turn on and remain on until turned off should be implemented as activatable mutations, so that there's a easy screen where the player can see what all is active and turn them on and off. Blood Arts which create an instant or temporary effect should be implemented as spells in the Supernatural Powers menu.
- It is currently possible for a player to eventually learn every single available Blood Art, so be careful of unexpected synergies.

### Dhampirs

Dhampirs are the children of a lower-tier vampire, one who has not yet made the awful choice to become an undead monster, and a mortal (or, rarely, another lower-tier vampire). They inherit a portion of vampire power but also some vampiric weaknesses. Dhampirs are innately capable of sensing both vampires and renfields, and will sometimes become vampire hunters because they cannot help but be aware of the threat.

Dhampirs naturally regenerate the blood vitamin uses to power their Blood Arts, but intentionally do so very slowly. The dhampir gameplay loop is designed to always tempt to them drink blood for power, to facilitate the "am I a man, or a monster?" question that often plagues fictional dhampirs, but also punish them in turn if they do. Dhampirs gain two weaknesses from a set of thematically-appropriate ones, but if they've ever drunk blood--even once--this list is expanded and they become eligible for more total weaknesses.

Dhampirs can use tier 1, 2, and 3 Blood Arts, though they should not have any shapeshifting or Blood Arts that rely on the vampire being undead (such as falling off a ten-story building and taking no damage). 

Some dhampir-exclusive abilities, and some vampire Blood Arts when used by dhampirs, only function when they have `empowered blood`, which is when the blood vitamins is at 1 or higher. When `enervated` (at blood vitamin 0 or lower), they suffer minor but slow scaling penalties to hunger, thirst, sleepiness, and stamina. Dhampir do not suffer from the `withering`, and while they can become `blood_quenched`, they can only do so by drinking blood.
