### Agents of Change
I want to take this space to thank GuardianDll for all the time we've talked about what to do in this mod and the work they have put into creating content for this mod.  I'd also like to thank TheShadowFerret for patiently reviewing my PRs no matter how hare brained my sentence structure is at any given time.  Ramza13 for creating the EOC system that I've used so heavily in this mod and all of the dev team for their assistance in correcting my attempts and sometimes even building c++ functions related to all the mods and systems I work on.

# Lore
The logic behind the Xedra Evolved Δ.  Imagine if the time from blob contamination to portal storm was basically several decades and portal intrusions built up over that timeframe with contamination zones resulting in parts of our world following other laws of physics.  So you have humanity starting to adapt to the dead rising but it takes twelve hours for them to reanimate and sometimes portals to other dimensions open and usually monsters/disease spill out but sometimes riches spill out and the government has projects exploring other dimensions and hunting Exodii nodes for cybernetic parts.
Then eventually the Cataclysm occurs and Kaiju appear with natural disasters and the dead rise instantly and everything still collapses. But now the Exodii and interdimensional scavengers are here so if you start with CBMs they may recognize that you were part of an organization that hunted them.
# I want to believe
Classes and scenarios specific to this mod will likely revolve around either investigating Xedra or working for Xedra or another alphabet soup agency.  Each section of this mod will expand on various monster of the week ideas.   The first set of monsters I'm exploring are what if our world became contaminated by a Nether realm that is the origin of the Kindly Ones, the good people under the hill, the fae.  Future sections will revolve around whatever mythos has caught my attention that week and that I can create reasonable content for.   

## Chapter 1 Hail Arcadia
The first bit of content for Xedra Evolved revolves around a dimension that's relatively nearby in Nether terms, even pre-portal technology mankind had records of encounters with beings matching the descriptions of these creatures across multiple cultures and times.  Future additions will explore other avenues.  Welcoming mapgen and monsters in this section. A musician at the Refugee Center might have some knowledge about these creatures. 
### Rumours of New Birth
When dimensional seepage began many of the fae returned to their old places of power.  This included the elemental fae which were less likely to interact with humans due to a more alien lifecycle.  As the Cataclysm began most of the fae left for less actively hostile dimensions.  In the case of the elemental fae this proves to be a problem as their unborn children aren't carried in the belly of a fae but rather are born over time in sacred locations, known as genius locii.  In hidden locations across the Earth a few unlucky elemental fae are waking up to find themselves abandoned in a dying world.  Maybe they'll be able to find a way out, one day.  

## Chapter 2 Powers beyond mere imagination
This section introduces several magical classes and spells and abilities for the these classes.  The player can grasp powers that they never dreamed of before the portals to other worlds started opening.  This magical system can be used alongside Magiclysm's but doesn't require it. The goal is for each of the classes to feel different from each other.  Currently looking for mapgen locations that could play a good host for the various items that grant these powers.  Such as pawn shops, museums and monster lairs.

## Chapter 3 A Thirst for Blood
The third chapter has brought with it Vampires both as monsters and as a disease that can infect you the player character and render you a being with unnatural powers and thirsts.  This section has also added some CBMs and the monsters you can dissect them out of.   Looking for more location, similarly themed CBMs and content for Vampire Hunters including NPCs and quests. The ability to use the blood you consume to power new abilities has been added.  Vampire traits are a side lane of the mutation code and should be available no matter what threshold you pursue.

Perks for Bombastic Perks and Xedra Evolved.
Alchemy requires that you also be running bombastic perks. The level five alchemy recipes are taking their time and this PR has gotten too large as it is, for other people to review. There are four levels of Alchemy, level one is slightly buffed versions of common materials and medicines. Level two are more advanced versions of what is available already with on. Some of these substances might allow the imbiber to exceed his normal physical limits or to gain access to more mystical senses. Level three you can make substances that enhance their target to superhuman levels or create materials that exceed normal limitations (supernaturally strong alloys, etc). Level four should have single mutations and attribute increases. Level 5 should have character defining post thresh mutations and effects that transform the PC. Cold Iron is an example of a branching Alchemy specialty that focuses on building gear that targets fae.
And a plethora of other effects, furniture/terrain, missions, lore and other things necessary to support the above.






















####SPOILERS
After becoming infected with the vampire virus by being grabbed and bitten by one of the vampire mobs that currently haunt some cathedrals and often roam with feral humans, the PC can either let the disease run its course or create the sketchy antidote found on vampire corpses.  Over the course of roughly 3.3 days per stage you will go through three stages of becoming a vampire.  A fourth and fifth stage are attainable through a mentor's guidance and the player deciding to permanently embrace vampirism. There is no return from these two stages, but they give stronger powers than the first three stages.  Once you become a vampire you will need to consume blood.  Only human or fae blood will work.  If you do not consume *HUMAN* or *FAE* blood regularly you will slowly acquire effects of blood starvation and eventually die.
