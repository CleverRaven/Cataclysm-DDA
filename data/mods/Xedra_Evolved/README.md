### Agents of Change
I want to take this space to thank GuardianDll for all the time we've talked about what to do in this mod and the work they have put into creating content for this mod.  I'd also like to thank TheShadowFerret for patiently reviewing my PRs no matter how hare brained my sentence structure is at any given time.  Ramza13 for creating the EOC system that I've used so heavily in this mod and all of the dev team for their assistance in correcting my attempts and sometimes even building c++ functions related to all the mods and systems I work on.

# Lore
The logic behind the Xedra Evolved Δ.  Imagine if the time from blob contamination to portal storm was basically several decades and portal intrusions built up over that timeframe with contamination zones resulting in parts of our world following other laws of physics.  So you have humanity starting to adapt to the dead rising but it takes twelve hours for them to reanimate and sometimes portals to other dimensions open and usually monsters/disease spill out but sometimes riches spill out and the government has projects exploring other dimensions and hunting Exodii nodes for cybernetic parts.
Then eventually the Cataclysm occurs and Kaiju appear with natural disasters and the dead rise instantly and everything still collapses. But now the Exodii and interdimensional scavengers are here so if you start with CBMs they may recognize that you were part of an organization that hunted them.
# I want to believe
Classes and scenarios specific to this mod will likely revolve around either investigating Xedra or working for Xedra or another alphabet soup agency.  Each section of this mod will expand on various monster of the week ideas.   The first set of monsters I'm exploring are what if our world became contaminated by a Nether realm that is the origin of the Kindly Ones, the good people under the hill, the fae.  Future sections will revolve around whatever mythos has caught my attention that week and that I can create reasonable content for.   

## Chapter 1 Hail Arcadia
The first bit of content for Xedra Evolved revolves around a dimension that's relatively nearby in Nether terms, even pre-portal technology mankind had records of encounters with beings matching the descriptions of these creatures across multiple cultures and times.  Future additions will explore other avenues.  Welcoming mapgen and monsters in this section. A musician at the Refugee Center might have some knowledge about these creatures.

## Chapter 2 Powers beyond mere imagination
This section introduces several magical classes and spells and abilities for the these classes.  The player can grasp powers that they never dreamed of before the portals to other worlds started opening.  This magical system can be used alongside Magiclysm's but doesn't require it. The goal is for each of the classes to feel different from each other.  Currently looking for mapgen locations that could play a good host for the various items that grant these powers.  Such as pawn shops, museums and monster lairs.

## Chapter 3 A Thirst for Blood
The third chapter has brought with it Vampires both as monsters and as a disease that can infect you the player character and render you a being with unnatural powers and thirsts.  This section has also added some CBMs and the monsters you can dissect them out of.   Looking for more location, similarly themed CBMs and content for Vampire Hunters including NPCs and quests. The ability to consume blood via spell and to use that blood to power new abilities has been added.  Vampire traits are a side lane of the mutation code and should be available no matter what threshold you pursue.

####SPOILERS
After becoming infected with the vampire virus by being grabbed and bitten by one of the vampire mobs that currently haunt some cathedrals and often roam with feral humans, the PC can either let the disease run it's course or create the sketchy antidote found on vampire corpses.  Over the course of roughly 3.3 days per stage you will go through three stages of becoming a vampire.  A fourth and fifth stage are currently unobtainable in game and lack any content.  Once you become a vampire you will gain a spell that allows you to consume blood.  Only human blood will work and it must be consumed via the spell.  This is due to limitations in the vitamin system that would otherwise cause normal humans that ate blood to slowly gain vampire effects that they wouldn't be able to reduce ever.  If you do not consume *HUMAN* blood regularly *via the spell*  you will slowly acquire effects of blood starvation and eventually die.
