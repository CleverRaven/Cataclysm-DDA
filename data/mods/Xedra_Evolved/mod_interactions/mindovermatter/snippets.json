    "text": "Excerpt from 'Infinite Dimensions, Finite Magickal Systems by Tyco Arendt':\n\nThreat Classification: Psionics\nOpalPsi\n\nPsionically empowered individuals can often be disarmed using specific methods common across dimensions.  Identification of empowered individuals can be difficult in civilizations that either refuse or lack the knowledge of how to identify psionic individuals.  Upon discovery of any psionically active dimension, agents must immediately return to Cradle Earth and notify XEDRA-23 and then await further instructions.  Under no circumstances is any individual from a psionically-active dimension to be contacted or interacted with without the presence of personnel from XEDRA-23 present."
