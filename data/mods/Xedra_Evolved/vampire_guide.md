Once you find them you need to fight one until you are grabbed, then bitten and the bite is followed by text about a feeling like backwash into your veins. You will also gain the Wan effect.

About 24 hours after that you will learn a spell that allows you to consume blood. Human, mutant human or demihuman blood. No animal substitutes. You will receive various messages about needing blood if you are running out of stolen blood in your veins and slowly move towards starvation.

You’ll gain a couple more abilities over the next twenty-four to forty-eight hours. You can access the mutation menu to use activated mutations by pressing [.
