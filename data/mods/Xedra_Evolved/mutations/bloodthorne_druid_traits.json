You aren't sure where it came from or what its natural habitat is, but now it's a part of you.  You require slightly more food and water than normal to feed it, but have the power to fight back against the blood-drinkers.\n\nVampire blood taken from their dying hearts and stolen power from the wood-elemental fey will both fuel your Heartvines.  Enough of both will allow you to unlock new gifts.",
