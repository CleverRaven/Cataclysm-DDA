I spent my entire life killing all the vampires I could find but I recently realized that doing so was futile with my current power.  I need more power.  No matter how many vampires I kill, there's always more.\nI became a vampire so I could kill them all, but even that wasn't enough.  I've followed the mentor's instructions until they had nothing more to tell me but that wasn't enough.\nI need to find a way to reach power undreamt of.  To protect everyone from the vampire threat, I must become the strongest vampire ever seen.",

It might be that this path gives a single weakness not seen in other vampires to those far enough on it, but testing this would require creating vampires and I won't ever tolerate this.",
