      "There could be anything out there.  Remember towards the end before the apocalypse?  I remember tons of weird stuff I heard on the radio.  Like, I heard out past Bunyan there were strange trees and species showing up in the deep woods, stuff no one had ever seen before.  The Border Patrol was going in about 'species previously thought extinct' or something like that.  Didn't make sense to me.  Why the heck was the *Border Patrol* talking about *closing off forests*?  Weird stuff.  I guess that means I don't have a clue what's out there now.",

Hundreds of miles from any border.  Weird stuff man, I wonder if it's all connected?"
