Subject and experimenter facing away from each other, with opaque curtain blocking line of sight.  Prompt was triggered by a light on subject's desk to prevent drawing any information from experimenter's tone of voice or word choice.  Experimenter drew ten cards and asked subject to state number and suit.  Cards are shuffled back into the deck after each guess to prevent already-drawn cards from affecting future guesses.\n\nResults: Subject guessed two of ten correct on the first test and three of ten correct on the second test, versus control who guessed a single card correct on the first test and zero correct on the second test.  Very promising initial results."

The mathematician stared at Dr. Davies for approximately three seconds and then, before security could intervene, physically attacked the doctor with their bare hands.  Witnesses report the mathematician incoherently screaming, mixed with statements such as \"You'll kill us all\" and \"Stop, stop stop\".  The mathematician continued to scream until restrained and sedated.\n\nFollow-up: COLD BELOW overseers received official reprimand and required to attend additional training.  Mathematician diverted to project SUBSTRATE."
