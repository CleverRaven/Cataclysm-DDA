Despite the known combat capabilities of XE157 and with no regard for his own safety, Sergeant Collins ordered his team to retreat to the dive breachhead and engaged it in hand-to-hand combat, holding it off for several minutes while his team exited the dive.  The aperture was held open for an additional minute afterward, allowing just enough time for a severely-injured Sergeant Collins to exit the dive and preventing the exit of XE157.  Sergeant Collins suffered severe lacerations, the loss of two fingers, and burns across fifty percent of his arms and upper body; he has since volunteered to be a test subject for SMOKE USHER.

That's the wrong question.  This isn't a codified martial art, it's just using dimensional metaphysics to enhance existing methods of combat.  A VERDANT HAND candidate will be better at Muay Thai than anyone who hasn't gone through BURNT NOVEMBER but they still need the actual martial arts training.  This is just another tool.

Netherum mathematics is an inexact science, as you well know, so it's very hard to find a protocol that will work the same every time.  Melchior has the advantage of processing speed but our mathematicians have to put in the hours, but they can make connections Melchior cannot because he can only work with the data he's given, whereas NOBLE HORIZON provides new data.  But, unpredictably.  We've discovered any number of immersion destinations where the physical laws are so different even the probes wouldn't work, much less a dive team.  The majority of them, even BURNT NOVEMBER wouldn't be sufficient to sustain a diver.  There's no value in exotic materials that will probably not survive the transition.\n\nOn the other hand, COLD BELOW did discover Plane 398RG and we got quite a few awakenings out of it before testing was prohibited.  And on the other other hand, they found 9472P where the entire world's biomass had been assimilated by XE157 and we lost the entire dive team because XE157 ignored the probes.  It's like that bell curve meme where Melchior is in the middle and COLD BELOW is both ends.  If only we had a better way to get the far side."

Melchior provided a six-digit number and both teams attempted to guess it.  GRAY DAWN were competitive when the number was overseen by a third party, as expected, but when both teams were provided with a terminal interface and instructed to enter their guesses, GRAY DAWN scored no better than chance.  On the other hand, NOBLE HORIZON consistently managed to guess at least three digits and successfully guessed the entire six-digit sequence twice (out of ten total sequences).  This disparity was maintained when both groups were placed in empty rooms, instructed to write down their guesses on a sheet of paper, and place it into a box before leaving the room.  Finally, NOBLE HORIZON attained a better than chance score on the final test, when both groups were instructed to guess the sequence before Melchior was asked to provide a sequence.\n\nThis leads to two conclusions.  The first is that the alarmists are wrong; Melchior is not secretly harboring a genius intellect and plotting to control XEDRA from within, it is a computer, capable of processing vast amounts of data and using netherum mathematics to process that data much faster than would otherwise be possible.  The second is that while GRAY DAWN requires a specific source from which to attain new information, NOBLE HORIZON does not.  Even in situations where no information transfer would be possible, such as the final two testing scenarios, NOBLE HORIZON still had a better-than-chance rate of correctly determining the sequence."

There's no conceptual reason why a pyrokinetic couldn't make all the molecules of an object move in a particular direction, producing motion of the entire object, or a telekinetic couldn't produce a more chaotic motion that resulted in the object's energy increasing.  Furthermore, in no test has a telekinetic been able to move part of an object unless that part is designed for motion; pulling a lever is possible, but breaking a plate in half is not.  And a pyrokinetic cannot apply the reverse and slow down an object's molecules to reduce heat unless that object is on fire.\n\nMy theory is that it's all psychological.  We've all grown up with modern culture and stories about what psychics are \"supposed\" to be capable of, and so the matrix crystals and Netherum mathematics shape the candidates' abilities toward those pre-determined pathways.  If we could get a SMOKE USHER mathematician from an uncontacted tribe, maybe they'd be able to induce diseases in their targets or steal their soul, in accordance with that tribe's beliefs and practices about supernatural powers.  But since our candidates come from a culture where pyrokinesis and telekinesis are separate things and geokinesis or osteokinesis are very rare to nonexistent in fiction, the former result from awakenings and the latter do not.\n\nI would like to formally request a wider variety of cultural backgrounds for our project candidates to test this theory."

We've done a lot of experiments to find some sort of consequences for the TKs and so far there's nothing other than the standard metabolic cost.  Netherum mathematics is work, but the mechanism of the force is unclear.  We've already tried both a scale and water displacement and neither of them showed any measurable counterforce.  That leaves a few possibilities:/n1)There is no counterforce.  That breaks classical mechanics in half but frankly we're already at that point anyway.\n2)The counterforce is exerted elsewhere, such as the Netherum.  This is basically just handwavium, \"well, we can't see it but it must be out there.\"  Must it?  Plus then the counterforce isn't actually acting on the origin point anyway unless you buy Dr. Ho's ridiculous \"The soul is a Nether construct\" theory.\n3)The counterforce applies in some way we aren't looking for, like, I don't know, DNA damage or other microscopic-level areas.  We already had comprehensive checkups and didn't find anything, but we're not entirely sure what we're looking for.\n\n\"we're not entirely sure what we're looking for\" is basically the theme of this whole project, honestly.

While it makes intuitive sense that larger masses would require more effort and control to manipulate through telekinesis, its actual behavior does not always follow logical constraints--see the way that barrier react to external forces.  In this experiment, we found that manipulating water flora was possible but bacterial samples and electron microscopes both failed.  Our initial hypothesis was that direct observation was required, but the bacterial test provided that is not sufficient to explain JUNIPER GOLD's limitations.

While the construction requirements are extremely expensive, including, among other things, three active matrix crystals, but it increases the range for GRAY DAWN communication up to several kilometers.

Even though our most powerful mathematicians can currently only teleport a few grams a few meters distant, we've used slow-motion photography and confirmed that while the transit is not instantaneous, it's still faster than c.  So, as the saying goes, relativity, causality, faster than light travel, pick two, right?  Which are we going to pick?\n\nWell, as much as it pains me as a physicist to say it, relativity, at least as it relates in this case.  Now we have a third domain alongside quantum mechanics and general relativity: netherum mathematics.  While I hesitate to speculate on something that we have collected so little data on, it is possible that the Netherum provides its own reference frame coterminous with our own (or multiple) realities.  If we built our satellites with matrix technology, would they still need to account for time dilation?  Would relativity override netherum mathematics in that case?\n\nBut to return to the title: there is no evidence time travel is possible despite repeated attempts.  Perhaps if we had a LOST RAIN mathematician capable of moving interstellar distances we could ask them to come back before they left.  Barring that, I'm afraid asking LOST RAIN to retroactively avert any disasters is not on the table."

You write here that the effect field has a \"94% effectiveness rate\" but this is not comparable to ballistic performance standards because it has no ablative properties.  What if the first shot fired is part of that 6%?  How can an operative trust their life to your device when every possible shot might be the one to penetrate?  That fact that your data shows it provides complete protection against rifle rounds, grenades, and even anti-tank weapons is immaterial in the face of the effect field's failure rate.\n\nSecond, you write that currently OS647-P has a 2.67% device failure rate, over and above the chance of the effect field failing!  You want me to recommend this for general usage when our field operatives could end up not only with a bullet in the chest, but also a box full of burnt plastic while some horror is charging at them on an immersion dive?n\nFurthermore, the active time is simply unacceptable.  Ballistic protection works because it provides passive protection with no additional effort necessary.  When in danger, an operative would need to insert the matrix crystal, flip the toggle, and then hope that the attack occurs within the \"5.65 second median protection time\" in order to gain any benefit at all!  You've read those immersion dive reports too, Matthew.  If an operative is face to face with XE157, what happens on the sixth second?\n\nI'll be frank with you.

The LV-429 solves all three of these problems.  Before the primary laser is fired, a secondary netherum mathematical beam clears the path of the laser, removing atmospheric contaminants without affecting the target.  The laser is fired in a series of short pulses, each much higher intensity than a standard laser, eliminating the need for extensive dwell time.  Finally, the power source contains a small ND-cell, capable of powering the weapon effectively indefinitely.\n\nOne problem remains to be solved.  While the weapon is capable of providing enough power for every shot in succession, matrix technology has not yet provided us with more efficient battery storage.  This means that the ND-cell must charge existing batteries, allowing the LV-429 to be fired only once every few seconds, obviously too low a rate of fire for any live engagement.  An attempt to overcome this limitation by including processed matrix crystals for additional energy production led to unacceptable heat levels, rendering the weapon unusable after less than a minute of sustained fire and, in one case, leading to the detonation of the prototype and the death of the tester.  Further enhancements in power storage technology will be necessary before proper deployment."

It produces energy with no fuel required, at a constant rate, with no waste byproducts and very little heat.\n\nHowever--there's always a however in this line of work--it has the significant disadvantage that prevents me from recommending it for deployment at this time.  COBALT RAIN works through a microportal to the Netherum, siphoning energy through without the possibility of hostile incursions.  During normal operation, this remains true, but if the device is damaged it can destabilize containment and the portal can rapidly expand without warning.  Just last week we had an incident during testing, and while the engineers were able to get the device shut down quickly, something still came through the portal.  We're lucky that it doesn't seem hostile or really even interested in us.  Despite its appearance (see attached), XE843 is indifferent to the presence or absence of others, light levels, food, or noise.  It just wanders around its containment cell.

        "text": "As requested, we conducted multiple tests using various matrix crystals to determine the precise effect on mathematician capabilities.  The first test subject was V72, representing JUNIPER GOLD.  In previous capability testing, V72 was capable of lifting 10.23g and holding it steady for at least 300 seconds, as well as consistently being able to reduce their acceleration when free-falling to 9.32 m/s².  When holding a charged matrix crystal, the effect was nothing short of astonishing--the mass limit on lifting increased to 2.43 kg and the acceleration when free-falling dropped to 7.17 m/s².\n\nBURNT NOVEMBER Subject Q51 displayed a resting heart rate of 65 bpm, a grip strength of 30 kg, and a 8:31 mile time.  When holding a charged matrix crystal, these improved to 55 bpm, a grip strength of 41 kg, and a 5:45 mile time.\n\nThe evidence shows that skin contact with a charged matrix crystal dramatically improves mathematician capabilities, up to several hundred times depending on their exact capabilities.  While matrix crystals are always in short supply, some of them should definitely be earmarked for usage by our most capable mathematicians."

        "text": "Colleagues,\n\nI'd like to take a moment to address the recent rumors.  I know that stress levels are high with the quarantine and the XE037 news, but there is no need to engage in unwarranted speculation.  In these unprecedented times, it's important to remember that we're all in this together and we will solve the problems before us, as we have so many others.\n\nI will be perfectly clear.  There is no \"Project GASPAR.\"  Trained mathematicians are the most important resource that we have, and it would be the height of folly to waste them on replicating a resource that already exists simply because the current state of emergency has placed us out of contact.  Furthermore, it is important to remember that Netherum mathematics are not magic.  They obey a consistent set of rules and we are capable of determining those rules empirically.  We can test how much a JUNIPER GOLD mathematician can lift to the milligram.  We can determine the effective communication range for a GRAY DAWN candidate down to the decimeter.  We would never simply \"throw things at the wall and see what sticks.\"  Science requires rigor.\n\nThese are troubling times, but we will get through them together.\n\nSincerely,\nHarold Liu\nDirector, Project PHAVIAN"

Just as we would respect the names and pronouns by which our co-workers wish to be addressed, we should use the approved terms for candidates for the various projects under our umbrella.  Some frankly disturbing news has reached me of harassment or even bullying aimed at those who have gone through the training process.  These people are not \"witches\" and they are most certainly not \"freaks,\" and I am frankly disturbed that I have to emphasize that point.  These are your colleagues who have volunteered to advance scientific understanding as we explore the unknown.  There is no reason standard HR policies do not still apply.  I have already received several complaints which I will be acting on in the near future, and hopefully I will not receive any more.\n\nSincerely,\nRosemary Pierce\nAdministrator, Human Resources"

I have to admit, though, that I was extremely disturbed by what I've heard of the behavior of several VERDANT HAND mathematicians, as well as Dr. Holland and Dr. Almeida's recent public argument.  As such, for the duration of the emergency, I think that your \"psi-cop\" proposal is a good one.  I'll draft a memo immediately to Dr. Nayak to organize the GREY DAWN mathematicians toward keeping order and maintaining morale.  Hopefully, this will only be the matter of a few weeks before Dr. Sidhu and his team can find a solution.  They already found one way to remove XE037 contamination, so hope remains.\n\nSincerely,\nHarold Liu"

As a member of XEDRA, you will already have seen many extraordinary things in the course of your work, things which you previously might have scoffed at or dismissed out of hand.  You will see more extraordinary things in the course of your work here, things that even those at other XEDRA divisions would have thought impossible a few years ago.  Phase experiments expand the range of human exploration, but matrix technology unlocks human potential to a degree never before seen.  You will be a part of that endeavor, advancing human knowledge and ensuring the United States of America's place at the forefront of scientific advancement throughout the 21st century.\n\nThere is an ancient proverb that is often translated as \"A single spark can start a prairie fire.\"  Our work here will be the light that will lead humanity into a new age.  I look forward to working with you.\n\nHarold Liu\nDirector, Project PHAVIAN"

The LOST RAIN mathematicians are universally reporting that something strange is happening to space itself.  You've seen the testing data about them being able to change effective distance between two points and they're reporting that ALL distances are being affected to a very small degree.  I don't know if this has anything to do with the erratic behavior from the staff or XE037 contamination but coupled with all the BURNT NOVEMBER reports of impending doom, plus all the news filtering from the outside, I think we need to prepare for the worst.\n\nJohn Goldberg\nResearcher"

We need them higher-up to test for line-of-sight-based range anyway, and we don't have all the problems that XEDRA-12 has with maintaining secrecy.  If some normie somehow gets past security and wanders in, they're just going to see an ordinary office with maybe a few weird room layouts, there aren't going to be wolfmen wandering the halls.  The mathematicians are just people, and if some of them are creepy, we've ALL worked with the creepy guy before.  If it were really that serious of a concern, we'd be underground like the LOST RAIN guys.  And with a bunch of clears here, we'll get warning hours or days before anything goes wrong.\n\nAnd besides, look at the advantages!  There's a gym and a bar on the ground floor.
