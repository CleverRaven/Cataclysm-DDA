Despite the known combat capabilities of XE157 and with no regard for his own safety, Sergeant Collins ordered his team to retreat to the dive breachhead and engaged it in hand-to-hand combat, holding it off for several minutes while his team exited the dive.  The aperture was held open for an additional minute afterward, allowing just enough time for a severely-injured Sergeant Collins to exit the dive and preventing the exit of XE157.  Sergeant Collins suffered severe lacerations, the loss of two fingers, and burns across fifty percent of his arms and upper body; he has since volunteered to be a test subject for SMOKE USHER.

That's the wrong question.  This isn't a codified martial art, it's just using dimensional metaphysics to enhance existing methods of combat.  A VERDANT HAND candidate will be better at Muay Thai than anyone who hasn't gone through BURNT NOVEMBER but they still need the actual martial arts training.  This is just another tool.

Netherum mathematics is an inexact science, as you well know, so it's very hard to find a protocol that will work the same every time.  Melchior has the advantage of processing speed but our mathematicians have to put in the hours, but they can make connections Melchior cannot because he can only work with the data he's given, whereas NOBLE HORIZON provides new data.  But, unpredictably.  We've discovered any number of immersion destinations where the physical laws are so different even the probes wouldn't work, much less a dive team.  The majority of them, even BURNT NOVEMBER wouldn't be sufficient to sustain a diver.  There's no value in exotic materials that will probably not survive the transition.\n\nOn the other hand, COLD BELOW did discover Plane 398RG and we got quite a few awakenings out of it before testing was prohibited.  And on the other other hand, they found 9472P where the entire world's biomass had been assimilated by XE157 and we lost the entire dive team because XE157 ignored the probes.  It's like that bell curve meme where Melchior is in the middle and COLD BELOW is both ends.  If only we had a better way to get the far side."

Melchior provided a six-digit number and both teams attempted to guess it.  GRAY DAWN were competitive when the number was overseen by a third party, as expected, but when both teams were provided with a terminal interface and instructed to enter their guesses, GRAY DAWN scored no better than chance.  On the other hand, NOBLE HORIZON consistently managed to guess at least three digits and successfully guessed the entire six-digit sequence twice (out of ten total sequences).  This disparity was maintained when both groups were placed in empty rooms, instructed to write down their guesses on a sheet of paper, and place it into a box before leaving the room.  Finally, NOBLE HORIZON attained a better than chance score on the final test, when both groups were instructed to guess the sequence before Melchior was asked to provide a sequence.\n\nThis leads to two conclusions.  The first is that the alarmists are wrong; Melchior is not secretly harboring a genius intellect and plotting to control XEDRA from within, it is a computer, capable of processing vast amounts of data and using netherum mathematics to process that data much faster than would otherwise be possible.  The second is that while GRAY DAWN requires a specific source from which to attain new information, NOBLE HORIZON does not.  Even in situations where no information transfer would be possible, such as the final two testing scenarios, NOBLE HORIZON still had a better-than-chance rate of correctly determining the sequence."

However, controlled electrocautery is used in modern medicine; can COPPER PRIME show similar levels of effectiveness?\n\nPROCEDURE: Animal testing was done on six cows in order to provide a sufficient volume of blood, since mouse or monkey subjects would be insufficient.  Three mathematicians were used, each augmented with a matrix crystal, to conduct the tests.  Each cow was immobilized and had a series of wounds inflicted using a standard surgical scalpel.\n\nRESULTS: While it was possible to stop bloodflow from non-lacerating wounds and non-arterial bleeding (mathematicians consistently failed to stop arterial bleeding), results were less than promising.  Two cows died immediately after the testing from blood loss and two of the remaining cows showed signs of infection in several of the cuts, showing a higher contamination ratio than electrocautery.  While better than a hot iron, COPPER PRIME is not of high enough effectiveness to consider using for wound treatment, and especially not if SMOKE USHER is available."

Minimum time was 45 minutes, after which B22 knocked and asked to exit.  The longest was 3 hours, though since I31 reported symptoms of frostbite the following day, he obviously did not follow experimental protocols to exit as soon as he felt significant discomfort.

        "text": "Why is there a distinction between pyrokinesis and telekinesis at all?  Fire isn't a fundamental element, it's the result of heat which is the result of molecular motion.  There's no conceptual reason why a pyrokinetic couldn't make all the molecules of an object move in a particular direction, producing motion of the entire object, or a telekinetic couldn't produce a more chaotic motion that resulted in the object's energy increasing.  Furthermore, in no test has a telekinetic been able to move part of an object unless that part is designed for motion; pulling a lever is possible, but breaking a plate in half is not.  And a pyrokinetic cannot apply the reverse and slow down an object's molecules to reduce heat unless that object is on fire.\n\nMy theory is that it's all psychological.  We've all grown up with modern culture and stories about what psychics are \"supposed\" to be capable of, and so the matrix crystals and Netherum mathematics shape the candidates' abilities toward those pre-determined pathways.  If we could get a SMOKE USHER mathematician from an uncontacted tribe, maybe they'd be able to induce diseases in their targets or steal their soul, in accordance with that tribe's beliefs and practices about supernatural powers.  But since our candidates come from a culture where pyrokinesis and telekinesis are separate things and geokinesis or osteokinesis are very rare to nonexistent in fiction, the former result from awakenings and the latter do not.\n\nI would like to formally request a wider variety of cultural backgrounds for our project candidates to test this theory."

We've done a lot of experiments to find some sort of consequences for the TKs and so far there's nothing other than the standard metabolic cost.  Netherum mathematics is work, but the mechanism of the force is unclear.  We've already tried both a scale and water displacement and neither of them showed any measurable counterforce.  That leaves a few possibilities:/n1)There is no counterforce.  That breaks classical mechanics in half but frankly we're already at that point anyway.\n2)The counterforce is exerted elsewhere, such as the Netherum.  This is basically just handwavium, \"well, we can't see it but it must be out there.\"  Must it?  Plus then the counterforce isn't actually acting on the origin point anyway unless you buy Dr. Ho's ridiculous \"The soul is a Nether construct\" theory.\n3)The counterforce applies in some way we aren't looking for, like, I don't know, DNA damage or other microscopic-level areas.  We already had comprehensive checkups and didn't find anything, but we're not entirely sure what we're looking for.\n\n\"we're not entirely sure what we're looking for\" is basically the theme of this whole project, honestly.

While it makes intuitive sense that larger masses would require more effort and control to manipulate through telekinesis, its actual behavior does not always follow logical constraints--see the way that barrier react to external forces.  In this experiment, we found that manipulating water flora was possible but bacterial samples and electron microscopes both failed.  Our initial hypothesis was that direct observation was required, but the bacterial test provided that is not sufficient to explain JUNIPER GOLD's limitations.

We can hardly use GRAY DAWN for long-term communications if 4 meters is the maximum range of effective communication.  However, I am pleased to report that OS812 is successful far beyond our initial expectations.  While the construction requirements are extremely expensive, including, among other things, three active matrix crystals, but it increases the range for GRAY DAWN communication up to several kilometers.  While this is still obviously too short to use for most practical purposes, it represents a very promising breakthrough over previous range limitations."

Even though our most powerful mathematicians can currently only teleport a few grams a few meters distant, we've used slow-motion photography and confirmed that while the transit is not instantaneous, it's still faster than c.  So, as the saying goes, relativity, causality, faster than light travel, pick two, right?  Which are we going to pick?\n\nWell, as much as it pains me as a physicist to say it, relativity, at least as it relates in this case.  Now we have a third domain alongside quantum mechanics and general relativity: netherum mathematics.  While I hesitate to speculate on something that we have collected so little data on, it is possible that the Netherum provides its own reference frame coterminous with our own (or multiple) realities.  If we built our satellites with matrix technology, would they still need to account for time dilation?  Would relativity override netherum mathematics in that case?\n\nBut to return to the title: there is no evidence time travel is possible despite repeated attempts.  Perhaps if we had a LOST RAIN mathematician capable of moving interstellar distances we could ask them to come back before they left.  Barring that, I'm afraid asking LOST RAIN to retroactively avert any disasters is not on the table."

That fact that your data shows it provides complete protection against rifle rounds, grenades, and even anti-tank weapons is immaterial in the face of the effect field's failure rate.\n\nSecond, you write that currently OS647-P has a 2.67% device failure rate, over and above the chance of the effect field failing!  You want me to recommend this for general usage when our field operatives could end up not only with a bullet in the chest, but also a box full of burnt plastic while some horror is charging at them on an immersion dive?n\nFurthermore, the active time is simply unacceptable.  Ballistic protection works because it provides passive protection with no additional effort necessary.  When in danger, an operative would need to insert the matrix crystal, flip the toggle, and then hope that the attack occurs within the \"5.65 second median protection time\" in order to gain any benefit at all!  You've read those immersion dive reports too, Matthew.  If an operative is face to face with XE157, what happens on the sixth second?\n\nI'll be frank with you.  I'm amazed that you asked me to approve this given its current device specs.  Matrix crystals--even depleted ones--are extremely valuable, and given their already unacceptably-high failure rate in training new mathematicians, Dr. Liu is not going to accept anything less than 100% effectiveness from an alternative use case.  You're simply going to have to refine OS647-P until it's more reliable.\n\nYours,\nAnna Richardson\nDirector of Research"

With some caveats, I'm afraid.\n\nWe put five volunteers through the OBSIDIAN RING process and achieved complete success with two of them.  LOST RAIN mathematician U23, previously capable of expanding or contracting the effective volume of a space up to two meters across by 15%, is now capable of displacing his entire body up to two-thirds of a meter, effectively allowing him to walk through walls.  CRYPTIC FORGE mathematician V97 displayed similar enhancements, suffering no ill effects when exposed to up to 4 Gy of radiation.\n\nUnfortunately, the process is imperfect.  While B54 underwent the process with no apparent effects, BURNT NOVEMBER mathematician E43 has suffered from persistent tremors and muscle weakness since emerging and NOBLE HORIZON mathematician Q12 is currently on leave after suffering from hallucinatory psychosis.  Both candidates are undergoing SMOKE USHER treatment and hopefully will recover soon.\n\nwhile matrix crystals are a rare resource, the sheer amount of additional power available to an OBSIDIAN RING candidate makes the resource expenditure worthwhile.  ONYX LIGHTNING may soon show real progress.\nAlexandra da Silva\nLead Researcher, OBSIDIAN RING"

Candidates that failed to awaken complained of headaches and bad dreams but the effects rarely last longer than a week (see fig 4).  In approximately 5% of cases, however, awakening causes serious side effects including hallucinations, high fever exceeding 39.5°C, muscle tremors, unconsciousness, disassociation, and amnesia.  This can occur in either successful or unsuccessful awakening and is a serious danger in certain cases (e.g. incident reports ID39483 and IC49378).\n\nMultiple awakenings are not cost-effective.  Despite a wide range of candidates and repeated attempts, only two incidents have ever occurred and no specific commonality between the mathematicians other than gender exist.  No further attempts should be made until a similar effectiveness to initial awakenings has been achieved.\n\nIn-phase awakenings show variable efficacy, sometimes much lower or much higher than normal.  Efficacy is in general consistent within each plane, though some planes show variable efficacy.  Plane 398RG shows 99% efficacy; however, side effects rise to 35% of cases and so further experimentation with 398RG is prohibited.  Melchior has so far been unable to find any specific characteristics of a plane that would lead to greater or lesser efficacy.  Further testing and sampling are required."

The LV-429 solves all three of these problems.  Before the primary laser is fired, a secondary netherum mathematical beam clears the path of the laser, removing atmospheric contaminants without affecting the target.  The laser is fired in a series of short pulses, each much higher intensity than a standard laser, eliminating the need for extensive dwell time.  Finally, the power source contains a small ND-cell, capable of powering the weapon effectively indefinitely.\n\nOne problem remains to be solved.  While the weapon is capable of providing enough power for every shot in succession, matrix technology has not yet provided us with more efficient battery storage.  This means that the ND-cell must charge existing batteries, allowing the LV-429 to be fired only once every few seconds, obviously too low a rate of fire for any live engagement.  An attempt to overcome this limitation by including processed matrix crystals for additional energy production led to unacceptable heat levels, rendering the weapon unusable after less than a minute of sustained fire and, in one case, leading to the detonation of the prototype and the death of the tester.  Further enhancements in power storage technology will be necessary before proper deployment."

XE037 enhances exposed mathematicians (aka all of them) by a factor of anywhere from 10x to 100x or more, basically as much as using a matrix crystal.  Meshram used to be able to lift around 18.5g, one of our strongest telekinetics.  Now he's up to 2kg and with a crystal he can lift two bowling balls.  Or a dog, that was hilarious.\n\nSubject U76 could pick up surface thoughts if touching the target and now can easily read someone's mind from across the room and can occasionally pick up deeper memories.  We figured this out by accident, by the way, and I'm pretty sure when we get out of here Dr. Connolly is going to find divorce papers waiting for her.

It's not actually a perpetual motion machine but it might as well be from the end-user's point of view.  It produces energy with no fuel required, at a constant rate, with no waste byproducts and very little heat.\n\nHowever--there's always a however in this line of work--it has the significant disadvantage that prevents me from recommending it for deployment at this time.  COBALT RAIN works through a microportal to the Netherum, siphoning energy through without the possibility of hostile incursions.  During normal operation, this remains true, but if the device is damaged it can destabilize containment and the portal can rapidly expand without warning.  Just last week we had an incident during testing, and while the engineers were able to get the device shut down quickly, something still came through the portal.  We're lucky that it doesn't seem hostile or really even interested in us.  Despite its appearance (see attached), XE843 is indifferent to the presence or absence of others, light levels, food, or noise.  It just wanders around its containment cell.  We've contacted XEDRA-40 to ask them if they want to take a look at it.  I'll forward the reply to you when we get it.\n\nWork to overcome this significant drawback is ongoing.

When holding a charged matrix crystal, the effect was nothing short of astonishing--the mass limit on lifting increased to 2.43 kg and the acceleration when free-falling dropped to 7.17 m/s².\n\nBURNT NOVEMBER Subject Q51 displayed a resting heart rate of 65 bpm, a grip strength of 30 kg, and a 8:31 mile time.  When holding a charged matrix crystal, these improved to 55 bpm, a grip strength of 41 kg, and a 5:45 mile time.\n\nThe evidence shows that skin contact with a charged matrix crystal dramatically improves mathematician capabilities, up to several hundred times depending on their exact capabilities.
