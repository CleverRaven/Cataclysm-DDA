Despite the known combat capabilities of XE157 and with no regard for his own safety, Sergeant Collins ordered his team to retreat to the dive breachhead and engaged it in hand-to-hand combat, holding it off for several minutes while his team exited the dive.  The apeture was held open for an additional minute afterward, allowing just enough time for a severely-injured Sergeant Collins to exit the dive and preventing the exit of XE157.  Sergeant Collins suffered severe lacerations, the loss of two fingers, and burns across fifty percent of his arms and upper body; he has since volunteered to be a test subject for SMOKE USHER.

        "text": "Why is there a distinction between pyrokinesis and telekinesis at all?  Fire isn't a fundamental element, it's the result of heat which is the result of molecular motion.  There's no conceptual reason why a pyrokinetic couldn't make all the molecules of an object move in a particular direction, producing motion of the entire object, or a telekinetic couldn't produce a more chaotic motion that resulted in the object's energy increasing.  Furthermore, in no test has a telekinetic been able to move part of an object unless that part is designe for motion; pulling a lever is possible, but breaking a plate in half is not.  And a pyrokinetic cannot apply the reverse and slow down an object's molecules to reduce heat unless that object is on fire.\n\nMy theory is that it's all psychological.  We've all grown up with modern culture and stories about what psychics are \"supposed\" to be capable of, and so the matrix crystals and Netherum mathematics shape the candidates' abilities toward those pre-determined pathways.  If we could get a SMOKE USHER mathematician from an uncontacted tribe, maybe they'd be able to induce diseases in their targets or steal or their soul, in accordance with that tribe's belief practices about supernatural powers.  But since our candidates come from a culture where pyrokinesis and telekinesis are separate things and geokinesis or osteokinesis are very rare in fiction, the former result from awakenings and the latter do not.\n\nI would like to formally request a wider variety of cultural backgrounds for our project candidates to test this theory."

She is now capable of running a mile with a time of 7:12 despite minimal training, well below the average for a trained woman in her age group.  She expresses increased well-being and vitality, going for walks in the facility exercise area when before recruitment she was mostly homebound.  Furthermore, her grip strength, blood oxygen level, skin appearance, calcium levels, and muscle mass are more consistent with a woman decades younger, and most convincingly to me, the roots of her hair are coming in black instead of gray and just last week, she sent an urgent request for menstruation products for personal use.\n\nWe'll have to revise our estimates way up.  I originally thought that SMOKE USHER would provide health and vigor but the benefits would be modest, maybe 20% increased lifespan with a corresponding increase in healthy years.  Hey, living to 100 regularly would still be great, right?  But SMOKE USHER mathematicians literally getting younger means I have to throw all the initial estimates out the window.

You write here that the effect field has a \"94% effectiveness rate\" but this is not comparable to ballistic performance standards because it has no ablative properties.  What if the first shot fired is part of that 6%?  How can an operative trust their life to your device when every possible shot might be the one to penetrate?  That fact that your data shows it provides complete protection against rifle rounds, grenades, and even anti-tank weapons is immaterial in the face of the effect field's failure rate.\n\nSecond, you write that currently OS647-P has a 2.67% device failure rate, over and above the chance of the effect field failing!  You want me to recommend this for general usage when our field operatives could end up not only with a bullet in the chest, but also a box full of burnt plastic while some horror is charging at them on an immersion dive?n\nFurthermore, the active time is simply unacceptable.  Ballistic protection works because it provides passive protection with no additional effort necessary.  When in danger, an operative would need to insert the matrix crystal, flip the toggle, and then hope that the attack occurs within the \"5.65 second median protection time\" in order to gain any benefit at all!  You've read those immersion dive reports too, Matthew.  If an operative is face to face with XE157, what happens on the sixth second?\n\nI'll be frank with you.  I'm amazed that you asked me to approve this given its current device specs.  Matrix crystals--even depleted ones--are extremely valuable, and given their already unacceptably-high failure rate in training new mathematicians, Dr. Liu is not going to accept anything less than 100% effectiveness from an alternative use case.  You're simply going to have to refine OS647-P until it's more reliable.\n\nYours,\nAnna Stephenson\nDirector of Research"

But may I remind you that off-the-shelf lighting literally comes from a shelf and you can go down to the hardware store and buy a dozen LED bulbs for $50 and they'll last you ten years.  There is no use case for a matrix-powered lightbulb that makes any sort of sense, even in hostile or in-phase environments.  Until you can achieve a similar cost-benefit ratio using matrix technology--check the budget for a single immersion dive if you need the data--I strongly advise you to take your research in a different direction.\n\nYours,\nAnna Stephenson\nDirector of Research"

        "text": "Initial testing shows that the rate of awakening from matrix crystal exposure is over 50% with no side effects.  Candidates that failed to awaken complained of headaches and bad dreams but the effects rarely last longer than a week (see fig 4).  In approximately 5% of cases, however, awakening causes serious side effects including hallucinations, high fever exceeding 39.5Â°C, muscle tremors, unconsciousness, disassociation, and amnesia.  This can occur in either successful or unsuccessful awakening and is a serious danger in certain cases (e.g. incident reports ID39483 and IC49378).\n\nMultiple awakenings are not cost-effective.  Despite a wide range of candidates and repeated attempts, only two incidents have ever occurred and no specific commonality between the mathematicians other than gender exist.  No further attempts should be made until a similar effectiveness to initial awakenings has been achieved.\n\nIn-phase awakenings show variable efficacy, sometimes much lower or much higher than normal.  Efficacy is in general consistent within each plane, though some planes show variable efficacy.  Plane 398RG shows 99% efficacy; however, side effects rise to 35% of cases and so further experimentation with 398RG is prohibited.  Melchior has so far been unable to find any specific characteristics of a plane that would lead to greater or lesser efficacy.  Further testing and sampling are required."

        "text": "Human-portable laser weapons suffer from three major problems--high power draw preventing them from easily being transportable or usable in skirmish combat, long dwell times meaning that the operator must remain exposed to return fire in order to do anything more than blind the target, and common atmospheric conditions like dust or haze severely reducing the effectiveness of the beam.  The LV-429 solves all three of these problems.  Before the primary laser is fired, a secondary netherum mathemathical beam clears the path of the laser, removing atmospheric contaminants without affecting the target.  The laser is fired in a series of short pulses, each much higher intensity than a standard laser, eliminating the need for extensive dwell time.  Finally, the power source contains a small ND-cell, capable of powering the weapon effectively indefinitely.\n\nOne problem remains to be solved.  While the weapon is capable of providing enough power for every shot in succession, matrix technology has not yet provided us with more efficient battery storage.  This means that the ND-cell must charge existing batteries, allowing the LV-429 to be fired only once every few seconds, obviously too low a rate of fire for any live engagement.  Further enhancements in power storage technology will be necessary before proper deployment."

Well, I've attached all the figures so you can look at them, but the theory is right.  XE037 enhances exposed mathematicians (aka all of them) by a factor of anywhere from 10x to 100x or more, basically as much as using a matrix crystal.  Meshram used to be able to lift around 18.5g, one of our strongest telekinetics.  Now he's up to 2kg and with a crystal he can lift two bowling balls.  Or a dog, that was hilarious.\n\nSubject U76 could pick up surface thoughts if touching the target and now can easily read someone's mind from across the room and can occasionally pick up deeper memories.  We figured this out by accident, by the way, and I'm pretty sure when we get out of here Dr. Connolly is going to find divorce papers waiting for her.  You'll probably want to keep U76 away from anything sensitive, except that we only just discovered this and now it's too late.  Oops.\n\nOh yeah, K34 can just walk through walls now.  So much for security.  Everything's fucked and we're doomed.  That's my report, hope you like it."

It's not actually a perpetual motion machine but it might as well be from the end-user's point of view.  It produces energy with no fuel required, at a constant rate, with no waste byproducts and very little heat.\n\nHowever--there's always a however in this line of work--it has the significant disadvantage that prevents me from recommending it for deployment at this time.  COBALT RAIN works through a microportal to the Netherum, siphoning energy through without the possibility of hostile incursions.  During normal operation, this remains true, but if the device is damaged it can destabilize containment and the portal can rapidly expand without warning.  Just last week we had an incident during testing, and while the engineers were able to get the device shut down quickly, something still came through the portal.  We're lucky that it doesn't seem hostile or really even interested in us.  Despite its appearance (see attached), XE843 is indifferent to the presence or absence of others, light levels, food, or noise.  It just wanders around its containment cell.  We've contacted XEDRA-40 to ask them if they want to take a look at it. I'll forward the reply to you when we get it.\n\nWork to overcome this significant drawback is ongoing.  At the moment, however, COBALT RAIN should remain in the prototype stage.\n\nAnita Morales\nSenior Researcher"

I know that stress levels are high with the quarantine and the XE037 news, but there is no need to engage in unwarranted speculation.  In these unprecedented times, it's important to remember that we're all in this together and we will solve the problems before us, as we have no many others.\n\nI will be perfectly clear.  There is no \"Project GASPAR.\"  Trained mathematicians are the most important resource that we have, and it would be the height of folly to waste them on replicating a resource that already exists simply because the current state of emergency has placed us out of contact.  Furthemore, it is important to remember that Netherum mathematics are not magic.  They obey a consistent set of rules and we are capable of determining those rules empirically.  We can test how much an ONYX LIGHTNING mathematician can lift to the milligram.  We can determine the effective communication range for a GRAY DAWN candidate down to the decimeter.  We would never simply \"throw things at the wall and see what sticks.\"  Science requires rigor.\n\nThese are troubling times, but we will get through them together.\n\nSincerely,\nHarold Liu\nDirector, Project PHAVIAN"

As such, for the duration of the emergency, I think that your \"psi-cop\" proposal is a good one.  I'll draft a memo immediately to Dr. Nayak to organize the GREY DAWN mathematicians toward keeping order and maintaining morale.  Hopefully, this will only be the matter of a few weeks before Dr. Sidhu and his team can find a solution.  They already found one way to remove XE037 contamination, so hope remains.\n\nSincerely,\nHarold Liu"
