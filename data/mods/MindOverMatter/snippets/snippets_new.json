Despite the expenditure of most of their ordinance, XE157 suffered no significant damage and continued its attack.  Despite the known combat capabilities of TIAMAT and with no regard for his own safety, Sergeant Collins ordered his team to retreat to the dive headquarters and engaged it in hand-to-hand combat, holding it off for several minutes while his team exited the dive.  The apeture was held open for an additional minute afterward, allowing just enough time for a severely-injured Sergeant Collins to exit the dive and preventing the exit of XE157.  Sergeant Collins suffered severe lacerations, the loss of two fingers, and burns across fifty percent of his arms and upper body; he has volunteered to be a test subject for SMOKE USHER.  In lieu of a medal, we have authorized a meritorious service bonus to be applied retroactive to the beginning of the year."

And not just the sex stuff, fine, whatever, but that he would get enraged whenever something would go wrong.  Carvalho came back from scouting and said he didn't find anything and Gallagher literally immediately thought about just shooting him and leaving him there!  \"Fucking worthless\" was the least-offensive thing Gallagher thought about him.  I know he's calm and professional on the surface but there's something wrong with him and one day he's going to snap.  I don't want to be there when he does."

Testing post-awakening showed the oldest awakened candidate--Doreen McHugh, age 62--showed a complete secession of her previously-diagnosed (at age 35) rheumatoid arthritis.  She is now capable of running a mile with a time of 7:12 despite minimal training, well below the average for a trained woman in her age group.  She expresses increased well-being and vitality, going for walks in the facility exercise area when before recruitment she was mostly homebound.  Furthermore, her grip strength, blood oxygen level, skin appearance, calcium levels, and muscle mass are more consistent with a woman decades younger, and most convincingly to me, the roots of her hair at the top of her head are coming in black instead of gray and just last week, she sent an urgent request for menstruation products for personal use.\n\nWe'll have to revise our estimates way up.  I originally thought that SMOKE USHER would provide health and vigor but the benefits would be modest, maybe 20% increased lifespan with a corresponding increase in healthy years.  Hey, living to 100 regularly would still be great, right?  But candidates literally getting younger means I have to throw all the initial estimates out the window.  Is SMOKE USHER the fountain of youth?  I know that sounds ridiculous but you can read the test data for yourself."

        "text": "Dr. Zweidler, I understand your excitement at your breakthroughs in matrix technology, but I hope you understand there is no way I can approve OS647-P for general usage.  You write here that the effect field has a \"94% effectiveness rate\" but this is not comparable to ballistic performance standards because it has no ablative properties.  What if the first shot fired is part of that 6%?  How can an operative trust their life to your device when every possible shot might be the one to penetrate?  That fact that your data shows it provides complete protection against rifle rounds, grenades, and even anti-tank weapons is immaterial in the face of the effect field's failure rate.\n\nSecond, you write that currently OS647-P has a 2.67% device failure rate, over and above the chance of the effect field failing!  You want me to recommend this for general usage when our field operatives could end up not only with a bullet in the chest, but also a box full of burnt plastic while some horror is charging at them on an immersion dive?n\nFurthermore, the active time is simply unacceptable.  Ballistic protection works because it provides passive protection with no additional effort necessary.  When in danger, an operative would need to insert the matrix crystal, flip the toggle, and then hope that the attack occurs within the \"5.65 second median protection time\" in order to gain any benefit at all!  You've read those immersion dive reports too, Matthew.  If an operative is face to face with a shoggoth, what happens on the sixth second?\n\nI'll be frank with you.  I'm amazed that you asked me to approve this given its current device specs.  Matrix crystals--even depleted ones--are extremely valuable, and given their already unacceptably-high failure rate in training new mathematicians, Dr. Liu is not going to accept anything less than 100% effectiveness from an alternative use case.  You're simply going to have to refine OS647-P until it's more reliable.\n\nYours,\nAnna Stephenson\nDirector of Research"

Candidates that failed to awaken complained of headaches and bad dreams but the effects rarely last longer than a week (see fig. 4).  In approximately 5% of cases, however, awakening causes serious side effects including hallucinations, high fever exceeding 39.5°C, muscle tremors, unconsciousness, disassociation, and amnesia.  This can occur in either successful or unsuccessful awakening and is a serious danger in certain cases (e.g. incident reports 39483-R and 49378-G).\n\nMultiple awakenings are not cost-effective.  Despite a wide range of candidates and repeated attempts, only two incidents have ever occurred and no specific commonality between the candidates other than gender exist.  No further attempts should be made until a similar effectiveness to initial awakenings has been achieved.\n\nAwakenings on immersion dives show variable efficacy, sometimes much lower or much higher than normal.  Efficacy is general consistent in each plane, though some planes show variable efficacy. Plane 398RG shows 99% efficacy; however, side effects rise to 35% of cases and so further experimentation with 398RG is prohibited.  Melchior has so far been unable to find any specific characteristics of a plane that would lead to greater or lesser efficiency--further testing and sampling is required."
