Despite the expenditure of most of their ordinance, TIAMAT suffered no significant damage and continued its attack.  Despite the known combat capabilities of TIAMAT and with no regard for his own safety, Sergeant Collins ordered his team to retreat to the dive headquarters and engaged it in hand-to-hand combat, holding it off for several minutes while his team exited the dive.  The apeture was held open for an additional minute afterward, allowing just enough time for a severely-injured Sergeant Collins to exit the dive and preventing the exit of TIAMAT.  Sergeant Collins suffered severe lacerations, the loss of two fingers, and burns across fifty percent of his arms and upper body; he has volunteered to be a test subject for SMOKE USHER.  In lieu of a medal, we have authorized a meritorious service bonus to be applied retroactive to the beginning of the year."

Experimenter drew ten cards and asked subject to state number and suit.  Cards are shuffled back into the deck after each guess to prevent already-drawn cards from affecting future guesses.\n\nResults: Subject guessed two of ten correct on the first test and three of ten correct on the second test, versus control who guessed a single card correct on the first test and zero correct on the second test.  Very promising initial results."

        "text": "Dr. Zweidler, I understand your excitement at your breakthroughs in matrix technology, but I hope you understand there is no way I can approve OS647-P for general usage.  You write here that the effect field has a \"94% effectiveness rate\" but this is not comparable to ballistic performance standards because it has no ablative properties.  What if the first shot fired is part of that 6%?  How can an operative trust their life to your device when every possible shot might be the one to penetrate?  That fact that your data shows it provides complete protection against rifle rounds, grenades, and even anti-tank weapons is immaterial in the face of the effect field's failure rate.\n\nSecond, you write that currently OS647-P has a 2.67% device failure rate, over and above the chance of the effect field failing!  You want me to recommend this for general usage when our field operatives could end up not only with a bullet in the chest, but also a box full of burnt plastic while some horror is charging at them on an immersion dive?n\nFurthermore, the active time is simply unacceptable.  Ballistic protection works because it provides passive protection with no additional effort necessary.  When in danger, an operative would need to insert the matrix crystal, flip the toggle, and then hope that the attack occurs within the \"5.65 second median protection time\" in order to gain any benefit at all!  You've read those immersion dive reports too, Matthew.  If an operative is face to face with a shoggoth, what happens on the sixth second?\n\nI'll be frank with you.  I'm amazed that you asked me to approve this given its current device specs.  Matrix crystals--even depleted ones--are extremely valuable, and given their already unacceptably-high failure rate in training new mathematicians, Dr. Liu is not going to accept anything less than 100% effectiveness from an alternative use case.  You're simply going to have to refine OS647-P until it's more reliable.\n\nYours,\nAnna Stephenson\nDirector of Research"

But may I remind you that off-the-shelf lighting literally comes from a shelf and you can go down to the hardware store and buy a dozen LED bulbs for $50 and they'll last you ten years.  There is no use case for a matrix-powered lightbulb that makes any sort of sense, even in hostile or immersion environments.  Until you can achieve a similar cost-benefit ratio using matrix technology--check the budget for a single immersion dive if you need the data--I strongly advise you to take your research in a different direction.\n\nYours,\nAnna Stephenson\nDirector of Research"
