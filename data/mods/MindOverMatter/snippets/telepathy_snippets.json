      "«Poor <bottom_name>…no one deserves to go out like that.»",
      "«Just one more death, one more kill and then I'll be right.  What?  No, why would I think that!»",
      "«When I told them I knew how to fight I didn't expect this.  This is nothing like the dojo.»",
      "«I need to go to bed early.  Just please, God, no more nightmares tonight.»",
      "«It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me\nAt tea time, everybody agrees\nI'll stare directly at the dammit why can't I get it out of my head!»",

      "«Why me?  Why couldn't this weirdo have talked to <bottom_name>.»",
      "«Dammit, I know I saw <weird_sky_thing> on shift last night.  Trust <bottom_name> to give me shit about it.»",
      "«Just let one of those <zombies> get close and it'll get some 5.56 right between the eyes.  Not too close, though.  God damn it, <top_name>, I told you to watch out.»",
      "«Wasn't that long ago we were all eating sushi at the new place in the city.  And now this.  At least I still have food.»",
      "«I would kill for some Foodplace right now.»",
      "«Well, he's definitely never going to write that last book now.  At least people keep bringing Smokes new books.  Don't know what I would do if I couldn't wind down with a good book.  Ha, \"time enough at last\".»",
      "«This was the year the Patriots were going to bring it home!  I wonder if any of those guys made it out?  At least the riots didn't start until after the season…»",
      "«So did everyone in the past spend 95% of the time bored as shit?  I hate this.»"
