      "You dream of running in an endless hallway.  You hear something gargantuan chasing you with heavy breaths and wet squelching sounds.  You run until you are out of breath and wake up exhausted.",
      "You dream you are swimming in the ocean, looking up at a million bright stars.  As you tread water, you feel a current from below and the waves around you die down, then you wake up.",
      "You dream you are wandering in a dark forest, cutting strips of bark from trees to mark your passage.  As you come to a clearing and see a strip of bark missing from a tree on the other side, you wake up.",
      "You dream you are standing on a beach under a sun, swollen and red and filling a quarter of the sky.  The air is hot, and as you watch the sun expands to fill a third of the sky, then half, then more.  As you close your eyes against the blinding light, you wake up.",
      "You dream you are sinking into quicksand.  All of your struggles only drive you deeper, and as the sand closes over your head, you wake up.",
      "You dream you are going down into the basement to look for something, but as you step off the last step the basement door shuts behind you, leaving you in darkness.  As you climb back up to look for a lightswitch, you hear the stairs creak behind you, and then you wake up.",
      "You dream you are waiting in a doctor's office.  Patients go into the door, but no one ever comes out.  As the last person before you vanishes through the back door, you get up to leave but find the front door locked.  As the receptionist calls your name, you wake up.",
      "You dream you are in a ruined city, full of empty windows and toppled columns.  No matter where you go, you cannot find a way out, and when you turn a corner and see your own footprints in the dirt-covered cobblestones, you wake up.",
      "You dream you stand in total darkness with the sound of something breathing nearby.  The breathing gets closer and closer, until whatever it is, is almost on top of you, and just when you feel a puff of warm, wet air on your face, you wake up.",
      "You dream you've taken shelter in a cave to avoid a howling snowstorm.  As you wait, you hear something crunching through the snow and feel the ground start to shake with its footsteps.  As something moves in front of the cave mouth, you wake up.",
      "You dream of flying.  You fly higher and higher until you are in outer space.  You look back at Earth and see that it's cracked - something is hatching and a thousand crimson eyes are fixated on you.",
      "You are alone in darkness.  You try to move, but all of your limbs are frozen in place.  You can't even blink your eyes.  As you wait, you hear a thin, reedy humming sound from somewhere off in the darkness, slowly getting closer.  You struggle frantically, trying to move even a single finger, as the sound approaches from behind your head.  Just as the humming finally gets within arm's reach and you hear it move closer to your face, you awaken.",
      "You dream of standing on top of a cliff in a storm, looking down at the sea.  Holding one arm up against the lashing rain, you watch as the dark waters slowly rise up the cliff, getting higher and higher until it laps at your feet.  You take a step back but the water follows you, covering your feet, then your legs, and then your chest, then your face.  As the black water enters your lungs you awaken with a start, coughing and gasping.",
      "You dream of standing in a dark forest.  The trees are so thick that not even moonlight penetrates to the forest floor, and despite waving your arm you can't see your hand in front of your face.  As you slowly walk, trying to pick your way through the forest, you hear the sounds of the insects and the wind slowly die.  The forest is utterly still except for your own breathing, and as you stop and strain your ears, you hear brush rustling in the distance.  Something is coming closer, slowly and inexorably, and when you try to run you almost immediately slam into a tree and fall flat on your back.  Despite the sound of your crashing into the forest floor, the approaching noises do not speed up.  As you try to stand, you hear the rustle of leaves and a wet sloshing on the ground nearby.  As it touches you, you start up in bed.",
      "In your dream, you are on the top of a mountain in the wilderness, with no lights nearby and countless stars wheeling overhead.  You lie down in the grass and let the cool night breeze wash over you as you look for the familiar constellations.  You find the Big Dipper with ease and trace a line across to Orion only to do a double-take.  One of the stars on Orion's Belt is missing.  As you look at Cassiopeia, you see the W is broken by a missing star, and then as you look at Leo one of the stars vanishes.  You frantically search the sky as stars wink out, one after the other, until there's only one left.  Polaris, the North Star, steadfast guide of sailors for millennia.  You stand and take a step, not sure what you're hoping to accomplish, and then the last star goes out and you wake up in a cold sweat.",
      "You stand in an office room, dingy yellow wallpaper on all the walls and the hum of fluorescent lights in your ears.  You open a door leading to another yellow-wallpapered hallway and walk down it for a few minutes before picking a door and opening it.

You open a door leading to another yellow-wallpapered hallway and walk down it for a few minutes before picking a door and opening it.  The door opens onto solid blackness and in your surprise, you trip through.  As you are falling, you wake up."

      "You dream of falling through a starry void, as the points of light around you slowly wink out one by one.",
      "You dream of swimming in the middle of the ocean, when clouds slowly begin obscure the moon and you feel something swimming up at you from below.",
      "You dream of stumbling in total darkness for hours.",
      "You dream of waking up and finding yourself blind as the undead bang on the walls of your shelter.",
      "You dream of walking across a frozen ocean.  Massive shapes are visible in the ice.",
      "You dream you are in total darkness with a frigid wind blowing on you, slowly freezing you solid.",
      "You have a normal dream of friends from the old days, but as the dream goes on the color fades until you're dreaming in black and white, and then the light fades until you're in total darkness.",
      "You dream of standing on top of a skyscraper and watching a sea of fog cover the city below.  One by one, the lights in the windows go out."
