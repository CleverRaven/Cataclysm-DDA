# Power Descriptions
Note that every power, unless otherwise specified, is affected by Intelligence scaling and Nether Attunement scaling. Intelligence scaling is normalized at 10 with +/- 5% per point in either direction—-Intelligence 9 makes powers 95% as effective, Intelligence 12 makes powers 110% as effective, and so on. 

A (C) after a power name indicates that it can be maintained by concentration.

All powers have a kCal cost equal to (Difficulty of power * 5) times a randomized factor from 0.3 to 1.7. This applies when the power is first used and when the power is maintained (if a concentration power).

# Biokinesis
**Note**: No biokinetic powers have a target listed because they only affect the psion. 

**Passive Power: Efficient System**: Reduces hunger, thirst, and metabolic burn rate by 3% plus 1.5% times the highest single biokinetic power the psion knows.

Level 1 minimum is 46.5 moves lost, level 20 maximum is 625. For the aftereffect duration, the target suffers a -30 penalty to speed, a -2 penalty to dodge, a -2 penalty to hit, and a -8 penalty to bash damage.<br />

*Effects*: Take over the mind of your target.
