# Power Descriptions
Note that every power, unless otherwise specified, is affected by Intelligence scaling and Nether Attunement scaling. Intelligence scaling is normalized at 10 with +/- 5% per point in either direction—-Intelligence 9 makes powers 95% as effective, Intelligence 12 makes powers 110% as effective, and so on. 

A (C) after a power name indicates that it can be maintained by concentration.

All powers have a kCal cost equal to (Difficulty of power * 5) times a randomized factor from 0.3 to 1.7. This applies when the power is first used and when the power is maintained (if a concentration power).

*Channeling Time*: 50 moves, minus 4 moves per level to a minimum of 10<br />
*Effects*: The psion attempts to shove a single target either to them or in a chosen direction.

By default, the formula is (power level * 25 kg) * Intelligence modifier * Nether Attunement modifier, divided by the target's weight in kg. If this is 1 or higher, the target is hurled 1 square for every 0.5 above 1 the ratio is. If it is below one, there is still a chance to knock the target over (chance is weight ratio * 100 in percentage; a weight ratio of 0.678 has a 67.8% chance of causing knockdown).<br />

In addition, the target will suffer a lingering teror--for the aftereffect duration, the target suffers a -30 penalty to speed, a -2 penalty to dodge, a -2 penalty to hit, and a -8 penalty to bash damage.
