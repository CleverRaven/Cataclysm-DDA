# Power Descriptions
Note that every power, unless otherwise specified, is affected by Intelligence scaling and Nether Attunement scaling. Intelligence scaling is normalized at 10 with +/- 5% per point in either direction—-Intelligence 9 makes powers 95% as effective, Intelligence 12 makes powers 110% as effective, and so on. 

# Biokinesis
**Note**: No biokinetic powers have a range or AoE listed because they only affect the psion.
