# Power Descriptions
Note that every power, unless otherwise specified, is affected by Intelligence scaling and Nether Attunement scaling. Intelligence scaling is normalized at 10 with +/- 5% per point in either direction—-Intelligence 9 makes powers 95% as effective, Intelligence 12 makes powers 110% as effective, and so on. 

A (C) after a power name indicates that it can be maintained by concentration.

# Biokinesis
**Note**: No biokinetic powers have a target listed because they only affect the psion. 

**Passive Power: Efficient System**: Reduces hunger, thirst, and metabolic burn rate by 3% plus 1.5% times the highest single biokinetic power the psion knows.
