# Power Descriptions
Note that every power, unless otherwise specified, is affected by Intelligence scaling and Nether Attunement scaling. Intelligence scaling is normalized at 10 with +/- 5% per point in either direction—-Intelligence 9 makes powers 95% as effective, Intelligence 12 makes powers 110% as effective, and so on. 

A (C) after a power name indicates that it can be maintained by concentration.

All powers have a kCal cost equal to (Difficulty of power * 5) times a randomized factor from 0.3 to 1.7. This applies when the power is first used and when the power is maintained (if a concentration power).

# Biokinesis
**Note**: No biokinetic powers have a target listed because they only affect the psion. 

**Passive Power: Efficient System**: Reduces hunger, thirst, and metabolic burn rate by 3% plus 1.5% times the highest single biokinetic power the psion knows.

# Telekinesis

**Passive Power: Lifting Hand**: The telekinetic may carry a single item next to them in a field of telekinetic force. The item's weight increases proportional to their highest telekinetic power, though they must use the recipe Contemplate Lifting Field to increase it.

Powers causing telekinetic damage have a 40% chance to stagger the target for 2 seconds and a 20% chance to down the target. Each of these is checked independently.

## Far Hand 
*Difficulty*: 1<br />
*Target*: One the items in a space up to 3 squares away plus 0.9 squares per power level<br />
*Duration*: Instant<br />
*Stamina Cost*: 1250, minus 80 per level to a minimum of 500<br />
*Channeling Time*: 50 moves, minus 4 moves per level to a minimum of 10<br />

*Prerequisites*: Starting power<br />

## Force Shove 
*Difficulty*: 1<br />

*Duration*: Instant<br />
*Stamina Cost*: 1750, minus 80 per level to a minimum of 750<br />
*Channeling Time*: 50 moves, minus 4 moves per level to a minimum of 10<br />
*Effects*: The psion attempts to shove a single target either toward or away from them. The distance is based on the ratio of the target's weight to the psion's power level (modified by Intelligence and Nether Attunement as usual).  By default, the formula is (power level * 25 kg) * Intelligence modifier * Nether Attunement modifier, divided by the target's weight in kg. If this is 1 or higher, the target is hurled back 1 square for everyone 0.5 above 1 the ratio is. If it is below one, there is still a chance to knock the target over (chance is weight ratio * 100 in percentage; a weight ratio of 0.9 has a 90% chance of causing knockdown).<br />

*Prerequisites*: Mood Stabilization 8<br />

Level 1 minimum is 46.5 moves lost, level 20 maximum is 625. For the aftereffect duration, the target suffers a -30 penalty to speed, a -2 penalty to dodge, a -2 penalty to hit, and a -8 penalty to bash damage.<br />

*Prerequisites*: Sensory Deprivation 8, Mood Stabilization 6 *or* Synaptic Blast 11 *or* Telepathic Shield 8<br />

## Psychic Scream

*Channeling Time*: 75 moves, minus 6.5 moves per level to a minimum of 30<br />

*Prerequisites*: Synaptic Blast 11 *or* Primal Fear 7, Telepathic Shield 5<br />

## Beast Tamer
*Difficulty*: 7<br />

*Stamina Cost*: 7500, minus 165 per level to a minimum of 3500<br />
*Channeling Time*: 120 moves, minus 3.5 moves per level to a minimum of 65<br />
*Effects*: Take over the mind of your target.  The target will not be hostile to you or run while the power is active, and may fight to defend you, subject to its normal behaviors; mind controlling a salmon is unlikely to provide a significant edge in battle.  Due to engine limitations, does not currently work on NPCs.<br />
