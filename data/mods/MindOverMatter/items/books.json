By lengthening the space between the teleporter and their target to build up momentum on their strikes, warping space to make near-misses turn into hits, or teleporting fractions of a meter to avoid incoming attacks or put themselves in a better position to make strikes, the TURQUOISE KEYSTONE practitioner can vastly increase their prowess in close-quarters combat.
