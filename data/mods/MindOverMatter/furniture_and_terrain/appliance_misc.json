    "description": "A strange device, a bit like one of those eyesight testing machines you look into in an optometrist's office.  The main housing has a place to rest your chin and a pair of binocular-like tubes, but there is also a headband attached to a set of wires hanging from a hook on the side and an armband hanging from the other side.  It's supposed to be used for measuring your \"noetic potential\".",
