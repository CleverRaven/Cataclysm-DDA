# Nether Attunement
Nether attunement is gained primarly from activating or concentrating on powers. Nether attunement is tracked via a vitamin and each rank of nether attunement corresponds to a certain amount of the attunement vitamin. Overall gain is not linear, when you have no attunement ranks, vitamin gain is slower but when you have any ranks of attunement, you gain more vitamin, faster.

### Chaince to Gain Attunement
Every time you activate a power, you have a chance to gain attunement vitamin based on the difficulty of the power, how many powers you activated recently and how many powers you are concentrating on. When you have no ranks of attunement, the chance to gain attunement vitamin based on recent power usage is lower.

### Amount of Attunement Gained
If this check passes, you then gain some amount of attunement vitamin that is controlled by a variety of factors. When you have no ranks of attunement, you gain attunement vitamin based on the number of powers you are concentrating on plus a small random amount. When you have any ranks of attunement, you will gain attunement vitamin based on the difficulty of the power, your attunement rank and the number of powers you are concentrating on. This latter part is why you gain later attunemt ranks faster, the more attunement ranks you have the more attunement vitamin you gain in a self amplifying cycle.
When you have torrential channeling or noetic resilience active, you will gain less attunement vitamin from power usage and the attunement vitamin you do gain is not affected by your current attunement rank, protecting you from the self amplifying effect of attunement.

### Attunement Power Scaling
All powers scale based on your attunement vitamin. When you have no ranks, your powers are 75% as effective. At maximum attunement rank, your powers are 300% as effective. Ranks 1-12 are visible in game on the attunement sidebar widget and in the `@` screen as the `Nether Attunement [#]` effect.
This power scaling applies to the effects of powers as a multiplier and to your attunement vitamin gain when you have any attunement ranks as mentioned above.

| Attunement Rank | Multiplier | with Noetic Resilienece | with Torrential Channeling |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  00  | 0.75 | 1.05 | 1.60 |
|  01  | 1.00 | 1.05 | 1.60 |
|  02  | 1.04 | 1.05 | 1.60 |
|  03  | 1.08 | 1.05 | 1.60 |
|  04  | 1.13 | 1.05 | 1.60 |
|  05  | 1.19 | 1.05 | 1.60 |
|  06  | 1.26 | 1.05 | 1.60 |
|  07  | 1.35 | 1.05 | 1.60 |
|  08  | 1.45 | 1.05 | 1.60 |
|  09  | 1.60 | 1.05 | 1.60 |
|  10  | 1.80 | 1.05 | 1.80 |
|  11  | 2.10 | 1.05 | 2.10 |
|  12  | 3.00 | 1.05 | 3.00 |
|  12* | 4.00 | 1.05 | 4.00 |

There is actually a vitamin level past attunement rank 12 where your attunement power scaling goes up to 400%. You have no visual indicator of reaching this point.
