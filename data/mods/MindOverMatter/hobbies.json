Controlling human minds is still too hard but at this point, animal minds are child's play.  A while back, some kind of mutated wolf or dog or something jumped you in the forest and after a few seconds, it was wagging its tail and jumping around like a new puppy.  You wish you still had it with you, but it died fighting off some kind of pink crustaceanâ€¦thing, giving you time to run.  The bravest dog you ever had.",
