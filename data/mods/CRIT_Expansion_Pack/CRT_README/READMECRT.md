# C.R.T Expansion mod pack
The core mod of the CRT Expansion mod pack, it currently adds an armor set, mildly OP gas mask and transforming vest, some gun mods, a new melee/tool and a new material. The items also use a lot of higher end materials such as superalloy, rubber (the "new" material), the lesser used hardsteel and also neoprene.

This mod also adds 6 new classes to CDDA: the C.R.I.T Medic, C.R.I.T Commanding Officer, C.R.I.T Automatic Rifleman, C.R.I.T Grunt, C.R.I.T NCO, C.R.I.T ROTC member, and finally the highly feared (OP) C.R.I.T Spec Ops.

I tried to keep the professions revolving around slightly upgraded army gear and as "balanced" as possible except for the C.R.T Spec Ops which is for trying out the new items and being stupid powerful.

Anyways, have fun and report any bugs you find.

I can't fix some things like the toolmods attatching to the vest and gasmask, but that doesn't hurt the game and it's just more of a cheap way to progress instead of getting a UPS, even though it still drinks a ton of power.
