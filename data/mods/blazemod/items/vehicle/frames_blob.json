While the original intent was to combine the structure of a bone frame with the impact absorption of the blob; the blob seems to have completely consumed the bone.  Instead, what remains is an amorphous mass of goo with what seems to be numerous thin filaments floating within.  With a bit of effort, you can grasp the fibers and stretch the mass into a multitude of shapes.  The mass is able to retain the new shape even under force, though the mass yields at your touch.  With enough strength, you think you can pull it apart.",
