Welcome to the new and improved blazemod, now with 90% less content. Over time this will be reversed as I expand on the scope of the base content
and restore some things that have been removed, but over a longer time scale without constantly having to break saves when an oversight has to be
fixed.

Where did most of the content of blazemod go, you might be wondering? Despite having gotten the quality of the code to a modern state, most of the
content is actually quite out of place when compared to each other, and each part including the basic essentials of blazemod deserve to be worked on
separately and properly implemented into the game rather than being kept in an uneasy limbo or left to be deleted.

If you want to keep playing with the content on a save that was compatible up until about the data 01/05/2020 (DD/MM/YY), you may download the
modernised versions of these mods from the following:

Legacy weapons:   https://github.com/Soup-de-Loop/CDDA-blaze-legacy-weapons
Blob stuff:       https://github.com/Soup-de-Loop/CDDA-blob-vehicles
Diamond & Vortex: https://github.com/Soup-de-Loop/CCDA-high-science-vehicles

If your save is older than 0.E, I recommend that you keep your older version of blazemod backed up and put it back into the game files each time
you update. I will be changing the internal ID of the new blazemod so that it's possible to overlap and ignore the new content if you choose not to
use it in lieu of the legacy stuff. I will be writing up a large migration list that should make it possible to update from any of the pre-0.E
versions of blazemod to the newest, that can be applied once to carry an old save over without segfaults caused by blazemod. Additional instructions
will be included once it is made.

Please note, however that I will also be working on re-introducing each of these parts of blazemod as separate mods unto themselves, better
implemented into the game and of quality and calibre worthy of spirit of current development standards.

If you have any questions you can hit me as Soup-de-Loop up on the master repo for CDDA on github, or find me as SouP on the developer's discord
server, the old (or new) fan discord channels, SDG's discord channel, as well as on discourse, or also as Soupymierr on reddit.
