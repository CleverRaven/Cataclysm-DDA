In this day and age, not having a deadly weapon in your home shows an appalling lack of personal safety, and I told him so.  Weapons that can kill a man, or several men, in an instant - sometimes even accidentally - are our only hope against other people armed similarly.

This extremely realistic and graphic alien autopsy shows an insect-like creature being dismantled by Japanese researchers, who comment on its anatomy in Japanese throughout the video.  Early observations that the creature was suspiciously similar to those described in the popular works of horror author HP Lovecraft were not sufficient to dislodge the video's viral status.  Yesterday, on the popular social media website Eddit, a 'making of' video was posted, clearly exposing the work as the final film project of a small group of students at UCLA."

Akron disappeared without a trace while on the job in Westfield, a small village with a population of only 824, on September 24th.  Her vehicle was found still running, undelivered mail left inside.  Her mother tearfully testified to the Oriole Free Press, \"Kasey was a happy and loved woman.  Wherever she is, we know she wants to come home!\"  Detectives previously suggested that Akron may have departed with someone she knew, but have not made any arrests so far."
