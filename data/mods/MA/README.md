# MA

Overmap overhaul mod for Cataclysm: DDA that uses some features of Massachusetts state when generating overmaps.

# Implemented Features

1. Use cities and towns of Massachusetts. Allow to start in one of them.
2. Use topography of Massachusetts.

# Plannned Features

1. Update topography of Massachusetts.

# Notes

Overmap terrain might be unpolished at times on some of the overmaps (e.g. fields w/o much swamps or forests), so you can edit region settings to spice up pregenerated overmap with procgen features.
