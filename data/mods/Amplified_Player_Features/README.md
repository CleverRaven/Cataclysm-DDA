# About Amplified @'s Features

This is a [Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA) mod, which aims to expand appearance traits in the game while supporting [SomeDeadGuy](https://github.com/somedeadguy)'s [tileset](https://discourse.cataclysmdda.org/t/32x32-msx-dead-people-tileset/18775). It also introduces changes to group behaviour, so NPCs can spawn with all the new traits.

It is basically a continuation to [Zetsukaze](https://github.com/zetsukaze)'s [Hair Extensions](https://github.com/Zetsukaze/Zets-Hair-Extensions) mod.
