You see hesitation on your sisters as well…does the hive need you to step up?  Would they follow?  Could you defeat Her?",

It feels like home, but deep down you know that you'll have to change and emerge into the dangerous, light-battered outside.",

Take the knife to one of the stretch marks on your back, and part the skin - it springs to the side readily and with no pain.  You work your way down your sides, changing the knife between hands as needed and free your <color_light_green>new skin</color> from its fleshy prison.",

Closing the zipper from the inside is a challenge, but you need complete darkness for what comes now.  You wait.\nAnd wait.\nAnd wait.\n\nCould you have been wrong?  You were so sure the time was right.\nYou need to get out of here, but you can't move your…anything.  Do you even have anything to move?"

Consciousness fades, but the pain stays.  The pain, and the feeling of myriad cockroach legs running on your skin, coating your wounds in a skittering, biting cloak.\n\nYou wake, shedding the weird apey memories, and you are stunned by a dizzying cavalcade of colors you could never have imagined before.  This is a step in the right direction, you decide, regarding your newly-expanded perspective with appreciation before the vertigo takes you."

All the pressure seems to well up into your head, and finally you feel a wet snap and a shower of too-warm mammal ichor on your feelers.\n\nYou wake up in a puddle of your own blood under your head, a puddle you can see despite looking straight up.  It will be some time before your eyes' crystals harden properly, but already the colors are even richer than they were before, and the world seems somehow sluggish."
