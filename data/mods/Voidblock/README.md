# Voidblock

A blend between Sky Island and Innawood that focuses more on exploring the island and surviving on it, rather than raiding the mainland. Also includes Magiclysm.

# Overview

This mod attempts to change Sky Block to be more Innawood-like. Your starting island has a lot more features, allowing you to survive and prosper on it without leaving all that often. Expeditions can be used to gain large quantities of resources you might otherwise struggle to acquire on the island itself. But most of the progression will happen on the island.

# Changes

-   The island has a hand-crafted map to explore
-   You need to create some clean water and survive 48 hours before the island lets you go on expeditions or heal you from dying on the island. (You can't just ignore survival in the beginning)
-   The forge of wonder can be visited from the expedition obelisk. This costs 1 invitation per visit. Invitations can be found from foraging.
-   Long sticks can be created without an infinity tree, but requires a long stick.
-   Other wooden items require tools to generate from the infinity tree. Same tools as you would need to acquire them normally. (woodcutting tool for logs, for example)
-   Withered plants can be crafted from material tokens without any workstation
-   cottonwood balls can be made from the infinity tree
-   Starterkit items spawning on the island has been removed
-   Removed urban expedition targets
-   Some autodoc items are no longer autolearned
-   Give exp from expeditions equal to material tokens earned (doesn't seem to work)
-   Give 25 exp for completing the Find the warp shards! quest (doesn't seem to work)
-   Removed underground bunker stuff (Building, fixing, items, quests) (You're meant to build your own base, not have the island build it for you)
-   Got rid of the pond creation

# TODO

-   Change quest craftables
-   Add ore in item form near ore deposits
-   Make sure all the ores you need are present on the island, including the stuff you need to craft a crucible.

## TODO before the mod gets officially released

-   Find a better name for the mod. Innavoid? Sky Grove? Skywoods? In the Sky? Fey Realm? Wood Between the Worlds? The Woods Between?
-   Modify json/ui/zenfs/mod_SI.json
-   Modify mods/Xedra_Evolved/mod_interactions/skyisland/paraclesian_eocs.json, or add my own mod folder

## TODO for later versions of the mod, probably won't be in first release

-   Make magiclysm gateway thingies return you to the island instead (Might be fixed in an acceptable way already)
-   Remove/rework autodock stuff, including construction groups? (Figure out how to remove construction groups)
-   Other ways to find forge of wonder invitations (Buy them from the forge? Rare monster loot? dangerous location loot?)
-   Consider not healing hunger and thirst when dying, having that be 'true death' conditions. This is a survival game, after all. But the island still has to save you if you get stuck in a drowning loop due to drowning during a mission.
-   Add magiclysm specific quests, like slay goblins, or a golem?
-   Rework the forge of wonders scryer to grant landing points instead of revealing locations? Would let you start your next mission at the scried location.
-   Rework explanation in dialog_statue
-   Add innawood and magiclysm specific starting locations, like caves, or goblin camps
-   Break out the magiclysm/sky island changes more? Version handling.
-   Consider each ore vein dropping a 'core' of the ore, which can be used to craft more of the ore using warp shards. Combine them to make the infinity ore thingy.
-   Alternatively, let the player craft unattuned ore cores that can be attuned by using them on an ore vein, and then used as a crafting focus for infinite ore.
-   Consider reworking the tech tree somewhat to enforce that the bronze age is completed before the iron age can start?
-   Consider moving the forge of wonders to its own pocket dimension.
