# Design Document
Aftershock is a set of parallel dimensions to Cataclysm Prime that have until this point existed in a relatively Blob free constellation of planes.  These planes have had additional decades to expand upon the advances that dimensional travel and nether exposure can bring even if it's been mostly hidden behind corporate/military shells.  These worlds are cresting between cyberpunk and post-cyberpunk.  Uplifted intelligent animals and solar colonization are relatively recent occurrences in the last few decades but for many in this world it is a dystopia even before the Cataclysm reaches here.  Mega/Hive cities cover large parts of human habitation where the poor live on the lower levels and rarely if ever see large amounts of vegetation that grows on the upper levels outside of hydroponics farms.  Outside of the largest cities much of the planet has been declared nature preserves where decaying and dying towns eke out an existence that is both richer and poorer than what is experienced by city dwellers.  

### Areas seeking contributors
Faction interactions and new factions.  Currently there are two new factions in Aftershock. PrepNet and Whately Clan.  PrepNet is at war with the Mycus and the Whately's are mad scientists.  
Uplifted animal mobs and mutation lines are always wanted.  I'd love to see someone make a Rabbit or Jackelope line.  
Hi-tech item recipes.  Aftershock has it's own special crafting for ultratech and we'd love to see what you come up with.
Missions, locations, and lore snippets we want this to feel like a world just as real as Cataclysm Prime.
Please feel free to reach out to us about ideas and implementations.
