Map locations that exist or should be added to the mod. Feel free to expand on these if they are of interest.


## Settlements

### Port Augustmoon

The orbital starport and current planetary administration center of Salus IV. A normal play through starts aboard Port Augustmoon, and the station serves as gameplay hub to plan and launch planetary  expeditions

## Natural Locations

### Ravines
Great cracks in the planetary ice shelf of Salus IV. Primarily intended as obstructions to long distance travel. The bottom level is a candidate for spawning alien forests lakes and other biomes.

More ways to travel from one cliff face to the other are always welcome, be them natural or artificial bridges.

### Glacial Tunnels
Sheltered nooks within ravine cliff faces, these are the main forest analogues for the mod. Their slightly warmer interior should be an ideal spot to camp during long journeys and offer possible forage opportunities. Survivors from the discontinuity might have thought the same, so long abandoned survivor enclaves are valid spawns.  Possible spaces for expansion:

- More plants animals and natural features.
- Small ruined settlements.
- Small alien ruins (shouldn't be too obvious)

## Human Ruins

### Ruined Starcities
The standard town of the mod. Mostly formless ruins around a core of intact buildings replacing stores. The go to location that can spawn much of everything

### Cryovaults
Labyrinthine structures that held humans in preparation for long-distance space travel. Heavily shielded and provided with ample failsafe mechanisms, they are a source for valuable medical and technological resources. Often guarded by advanced robots. 

Should offer extra lives as a clearing reward (Create and store a limited number of clones of the player).

### Crashed starships
Jagged fragments of crashed star ships, each a fragment of an Hyperspace Age relic. Heavily irradiated or otherwise polluted these should spawn high level combat loot, guarded by either dangerous robots or local flora/fauna sheltered in the ruins.

## Other

### MI-GO vaults
Shelters of elegantly folded coral found deep underground. Dated from before Salus IV became a snowball earth these could be functional or in various states of disarray. If broken they are a source of moxphores, if intact there's probably a whole biome inside intent on keeping you away and the vault undisturbed.  Endgame location, and likely a foci for the mod campaign if that ever happens.

Talking to a mi-go computer wouldn't be out of the possibility
Accessible through deep glacial tunnels.
