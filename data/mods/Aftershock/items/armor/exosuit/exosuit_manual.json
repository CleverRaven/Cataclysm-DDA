Selecting, 'Enter', the option to Manage Exosuit Modules will display a list of the exosuit frame's module slots, which are a combination of compartments for mounting protective plating and hardpoints.  Selecting an item, 'Enter', will show options based on the slot selected.  An empty slot will prompt the pilot to select an available appropriate module to load into that slot.  Selecting an occupied module will prompt the pilot to unload the slot, unload/reload the module (when appropriate), or swap the module with another.  Modules can be manually activated through this menu as well.\""
