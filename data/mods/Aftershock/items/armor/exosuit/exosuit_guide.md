# Exosuit Guide


### Background
### Frame
The frame of the exosuit is a relatively simple design, easy to manufacture.  A titanium frame lined with artificial muscles, studded with connection points allowing quick installation and swapping of plating and modules without specialized equipment. A helmet can be attached to the frame, and the weight is supported by the frame without restricting the pilot's field of view.
### Underlayer
These are comfortable jumpsuits specially designed to integrate with the frame. Underlayers are not required for operation, but prevent accidental injury as the frame moves. Specialized undersuits are built for various environments or combat.
### PSU
Exosuits typically use a single large power supply unit, attached to the back. Auxiliary batteries can be attached as well, extending the runtime. 
### Plating
Each plating has a minimum weight of 500g to represent the connection points. The steel and plastic are based on 6mm thickness, while the VCC is 4mm thick to keep weight managable. Exosuits can accept a wide range of plating. Plastic, steel, and vaccum-cast carbide are common. Improvised armor has been found on frontiers and in the underworld. The plates are rounded, using a ball-and-joint system somewhat resembling a hard diving or EVA suit.

| Plating       | Weight        | Location
|---            |               |---
### Modules
A variety of modules are available, ranging from sensor packages to batteries to load-bearing modules to jetpacks. These are built in a swappable black box configuration, requiring only that the module be mounted on the suit's connection points.

### Power Consumption
The inital power draw for the frame is based on the Aftershock suit operation time, 45 hours for the frame alone. Adding plating and modules increases the weight, requiring power hungry support modules for all but the strongest pilots. With the frame, helmet, battery PSU and carbide plating, the entire suit weighs just under 126 kg, before any additonal equipment is added. For a default character, this means they would need several support modules just to move, and the minimum number would cut the runtime down to 21 hours. Fruther modules add additional weight and potentially power draw.
