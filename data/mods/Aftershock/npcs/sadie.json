I should probably look into that later, there should be more blood in there.  Ah, good enough, I can do a better job closing up later.  Kind of tingly, feeling everything moving again in there.  See, heart surgery isn't hard if you have the right attitude.  Well now, you need a good reward for everything you've done for me.  Here, let me inject you with this.",
