Intact cars are nearly impossible to find.\n- Fuel is much harder to find, almost all cars have no fuel in tanks.\n- Marauders, looters, and bandits everywhere.\n\nSee extended description in README.md.\n\nTo get the mod author's intended playing experience, consider:\n- Enabling wandering hordes.\n- Setting item spawn scaling factor to 0.5 or lower.\n- Setting spawn rate scaling factor to 1.5 or higher.",
