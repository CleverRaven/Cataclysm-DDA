# No Hope Contributing

## Design ethos

The aim of the mod is to make the world more inhospitable and challenging in as many ways as possible. All changes should either increase/add difficulty, encourage risk for reward and/or enhance the feeling of hopelessness seen through the setting.
All difficult encounters should be avoidable/escapable through some means to avoid bs deaths to stuff the player didn't intend to take on.

### List of temporarily missing features due to fallout of moving to item category spawn rates (Requires C++)

- Decreased amount of ammo drop from turrets: 5.56 - 120, 7.62 - 100, .50 - 90.

- Made all gas stations have 0 - 5000 units of fuel instead of vanilla 40000 - 50000 units. Also made almost all locations in mapgen have the same 0 - 5000 units of fuel, including avgas. Also made almost all cars have zero fuel. There are places and cars where you could still find fuel, they are just very rare.

- Also see #70325

## Ideal future changes

- The item spawn rate difficulties could do with some more precise number tuning.

- Vehicle difficulty settings akin to the item ones would be nice, the current option is a bit all or nothing for my liking (requires C++ changes)

- Leaning further into bandit prevalence would be good, with random encounters and full bandit faction camps being potential additions. Bandits would also be a fitting source of working vehicles/fuel.

- Small groups of high functioning ferals could be interesting to explore too and would be easier to kill than bands of bandit due to the differences in NPC/monster HP.

- Friendly factions should be removed or heavily altered to reflect the less hospitable world.

- I'd like to see CBMs reremoved from their old locations and moved to a hostile cyborg/robot faction that are encountered frequently in a similar but riskier vain to bandits to push for a more chaotic risk/reward feeling than just "wow this toxic dump with 0 enemies has a CBM I can use" as well as giving the mod more character. This could take the form of the exodii being more numerous and hostile or something entirely new.

- Necropolis should be reworked into a mutable so it looks less stupid and is more interesting to explore, there could also do with being more reason to go there. Could potentially also add wandering irradiated zeds around it.

- Portal storms could be more frequent and/or pose more of a threat. Changing the portal dungeon to be more random and treacherous while maintaining the idea of a ramping reward but now including other loot could be neat to encourage not just sitting it out.

- The mutant NPCs aren't fitting to the ethos imo, could do with being expanded upon or scrapped.
