# No Hope

The mod is based on the old lore where there was a full-scale war with China with many months of preceding marauding and civil disorder. Thus the world with the mod will be much more damaged overall, there will be much less loot etc.

The major goal is to make Cataclysm harder and harsher. To achieve this goal, I decreased loot spawn, made most houses spawn damaged, as well as most cars, and some other changes.


# List of features
- Returned some of the cut "sillynonsense" and other inappropriate (for vanilla) content, including, but not limited to: laser turret (rewrote description to mention it's working not on the solar panels, but rather on compact yet powerful storage batteries; updated drop list to reflect that), chickenbot, tankbot and tripod and made it spawn in some military locations.

- Radically decreased amount of ammo drop from turrets: 5.56 - 120, 7.62 - 100, .50 - 90.

- Returned old names and descriptions for turrets (they are manufactured by General Atomics and Leadworks) and security-bot (Northrop).

- Made ordinary walls hard to set on fire. Based on my old closed PR (https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/15537). Now you can't set it on fire using a simple lighter.

- Updated domestic mapgen pallette so now any window in most houses will spawn shattered with 70% chance or fully smashed to frame (20% chance). Intact windows will spawn only with remaining 10% chance. The same for wooden doors: 60% chance to spawn open (imagine it was pryed open), 20% chance to spawn closed but damaged, 10% chance to spawn smashed to frame. Intact doors will spawn only with remaining 10% chance.

- Removed most of the guaranteed loot spawn in every location in the game. The chances to spawn guaranteed loot was dropped to 50-80%.

- Returned mooseâ€™s legendary aggression. Now it's the good old machine of destruction as it used to be.

- Returned back flaming eye's ray of destruction. Removed flaming eye's STARE attack. Added almost identical monster - staring eye with STARE attack.

- Made hiding additional options when examining workbench-type furniture on by default.

- Removed all one-tile puddles of infinite water in all forest types.

- Made all gas stations have 0 - 5000 units of fuel instead of vanilla 40000 - 50000 units. Also made almost all locations in mapgen have the same 0 - 5000 units of fuel, including avgas. Also made almost all cars have zero fuel. There are places and cars where you could still find fuel, they are just very rare.

- Integrated "Cars to Wrecks" mod. Also manually checked most of the cars spawn in mapgen and set them to spawn at least slightly damaged. Intact cars now are much, much harder to find, though not impossible.

- Integrated "Mutant NPCs" mod. I like the idea, it's fun, so why not?

- Integrated "Extra Bandits" mod. Extra bandits of all sorts everywhere is exactly the thing I'd expect to emerge after the apocalypse.

- Removed all turrets from military vehicles.

- All LMOE shelter now have a rather high chance to spawn bandits inside.

- Slightly reduced stamina burn rate while walking.

- Made zombies don't revive by default. Reviving has some serious issues that can't be easy fixed, so until these issues are to be resolved, I'm disabling zombie resurrection in my mod.

- Reduced chance to drop military gear from zombie soldiers.
