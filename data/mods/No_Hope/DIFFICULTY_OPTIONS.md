# No Hope Difficulty Settings

## Item Difficulty Settings

As of writing there are 34 item categories in the game.
No Hope alters some of the spawn rates for the categories to a degree depending on the players choice at the start of the game.
These rates notably don't work with every type of item spawn rn.
Below is each category's inclusion/exclusion along with any reasoning:

item_category_id | included/excluded | reasoning
-------------------------------------------------
guns             | included          |
magazines        | included          |
ammo             | included          |
weapons          | included          |
tools            | included          |
clothing         | included?         | Corpses with no clothes would be weird?
food             | included          |
drugs            | included          |
manuals          | included          |
books            | included?         | Small category of mostly fluff items.
maps             | excluded?         | The reduced working vehicles/fuel etc mean reducing maps would just be overkill.
mods             | included          |
mutagen          | excluded          | Mutagen is already a rare reward.
bionics          | excluded          | Bionics are already a rare reward.
currency         | excluded          | Currency is nigh useless anyway.
veh_parts        | included          |
other            | included?         | Couldn't find much of note in this category despite it's size.
fuel             | included          |
seeds            | excluded          | Seeds are nigh useless anyway.
ma_manuals       | excluded?         | Martial art manuals are already rare, I think making dojos more dangerous would be better.
traps            | excluded          |
chems            | excluded          | These are either rare already or not really useful to the player as far as I can see.
spare_parts      | included?         | This category is very broad but notably includes basic crafting ingredients and vehicle components that should be affected.
container        | excluded          | I'm not 100% on whether removing containers removes their contents or spills them but either way doesn't seem ideal. Finding lots of empty containers fits the theme.
artifacts        | excluded          | Artifacts are already a rare reward.
keys             | excluded?         | These are just id cards and are already reasonably rare and usually offer risk/reward.
corpses          | excluded          |
tool_magazine    | included          |
armor            | included          |
exosuit          | excluded          | Exosuits are already a rare reward.
