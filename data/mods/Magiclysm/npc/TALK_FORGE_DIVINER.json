Of course, they'll cut you to pieces if you gawk at it too long.  I'll mark the location of one of these places on your map for one denarius.  I heard a story, not sure if it was true, but allegedly one guy tried to use the mi-go building resin as armor.  Apparently, it bore into the poor guy's flesh!  Like lichen!  His friends tried to tear it off, but it wouldn't bulge.  He was in so much pain they decided to put him out of his misery.  But they couldn't do it, because the armor was too good!  So I guess that in a sense it worked.  Heh.  The mental image still keeps me awake at night, occasionally.  And now you have it too.  You're welcome.",
