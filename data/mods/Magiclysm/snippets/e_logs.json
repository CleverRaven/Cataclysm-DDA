The image depicts a campfire in the woods as seen from a short distance away, though zoomed in quite far.  Several child-sized figures are crouched around the campfire dressed in clothes sized for a human adult, their species unclear.  Visible on a spit over the campfire is a human arm."

This fucking quarantine means there's no way I can get back to my place so I'm stuck here for the moment.  It's a pretty nice place so I'm not in bad shape yet but no one else here will fucking talk to me.  And can you blame them?  I met some guy who spat on me and tried to attack me while screaming that g-slurs killed his wife.  You've heard the news too, right?  Out in the forest in bands like-\"  The voice cuts off as indistinct shouting is audible.  \"Shit, gotta run.  I'll call you back!\"\n\nThere are no further messages."

Their arm is around another ravenfolk, who is wearing a flashy dress made of a series of multi-colored scarves, and both of them have their beaks open as though the picture were taken mid-laugh.  In the background are several people, walking around under a night sky lit by several floodlights.  The caption reads, \"EDC!!  At last!!  Living the dream\"."
