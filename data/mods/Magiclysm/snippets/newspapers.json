While the riots have us all on edge, lately many of them seem to be keeping to themselves.  My neighbors won't even say hello to me anymore or look at me when I pass them on the street.  Sometimes they leave for days at a time, and I swear I've seen fires burning on the hills.  There's something odd going on and we don't need any more strangeness with everything else that's wrong with the world lately.\n\nSincerely\nEdward Frost"

The members are alleged to have blockaded the entrance to a facility storing logging equipment, using magic to prevent authorities from entering for over an hour before surrendering peacefully.  While no one was harmed during the incident, all the equipment within was irreparably damaged.  Thaumaturgical investigators have stated that the damage is consistent with usage of the Cause Rot spell, knowledge of which is restricted to licensed mages per the MAGIC Act.  A spokeswoman from Gaia's Children stated that its members had taken, \"Appropriate measures to prevent agitating the local spirits and desecrating the sanctity of the Earth.\"  Investigations are ongoing."

No foul play is suspected at this time.  An initial report by medical examiners at Massachusetts General Hospital indicated the cause of death as multiple organ failure following a sudden illness.  \"It's very strange\", said a source close to the matter, \"Her organs all looked like those of an elderly person, even though 96 is barely middle-age for a dwarf.  She could have expected to live another hundred years easily.  If you ask me, it's all that research she was doing into the effects of Haste magic.  Probably hasted herself right through to the end of her life.  We've seen side effects in Haste over-usage before but never to a fatal degree.\"  When asked for comment, Dr. Olivia Wright, a professor of control thaumaturgy at MIT&M, said, \"The idea of \"haste-death\" shows up in rumors repeatedly but there has never been a single confirmed case.  Haste places stress on the body, of course, but the stress is accounted for as part of the effects of the spell.  Ms. Sivi's death was tragic, but fearmongering about the effects of magic helps no one.\""

The press release stated that efficacy had broken 90% and a full cure had been achieved for the first time.  \"Magic doesn't have a mind of its own,\" said AAMB representative Dr. Ssmthisk, \"it has to be adapted to new circumstances just as any other art or science does.  Just as new weapons called for refinement of protection spells, new diseases require new thaumaturgical treatments.\"  Dr. Ssmthisk also stressed the importance of the ongoing vaccination effort in overcoming COVID-19.  \" I know it's not the news everyone wants to hear, but a vaccine is really the only way out.  Even if every biomancer in the country licensed to practice medicine spent every waking hour and all of our mana curing COVID-19, it would still take us over a decade just to cure the people who have it now, and that's not counting any new infections in the meantime and takes us away from any other treatments we could do.  So please follow the appropriate precautions.\""
