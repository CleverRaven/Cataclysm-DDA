        "text": "Letter to the Editor:\n\nI am concerned about recent activity among the local goblin population.  While the riots have us all on edge, lately many of them seem to be keeping to themselves.  My neighbors won't even say hello to me anymore or look at me when I pass them on the street.  Sometimes they leave for days at a time, and I swear I've seen fires burning on the hills.  There's something odd going on and we don't need any more strangeness with everything else that's wrong with the world lately.\n\nSincerely\nEdward Frost"

Please bring our Theo back!\"  Local community organizer Shazgra k'Morħet denounced the claims, stating, \"I thought we had moved past this kind of blood libel rhetoric, but apparently rising tensions are all it takes for old accusations to resurface.  We've all seen the footage of the riots.  They're the most multicultural gatherings we've had in modern times.\""

While an actual prototype formula has not been released, the draft paper indicates that animal testing showed a five percent decrease in long-term mortality rates in rats suffering from a dozen different types of cancers.  \"A true universal healing catalyst spell would really be the Holy Grail\", said Dr. Olivia k'Ħarzag, Director of Thaumaturgical Oncology Research at Johns Hopkins University.  \"Modern cancer research's greatest limiting factor is that the most potent biomantic healing spells can only affect the caster.  If we can find a way to encourage the body's own defenses that works on a wide scale, even if we can't directly cure the cancer, we could save so many more people.\""
