        "text": "Yesterday Gregory Hamilton, the local Wizard Enforcer, went on a rampage in the local shopping district.  Known for being the most powerful mage in Syracuse, New York, it is unsurprising that he managed to reduce the entire district into a smoking crater.  The National Guard took him out with a team of snipers and 5 helicopters.  Casualties are unknown, but current estimates are 15,000 and climbing."
