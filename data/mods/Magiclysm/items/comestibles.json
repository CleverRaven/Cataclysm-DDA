    "//": "Alchemically speaking, I see this egg as having the elements of Growth, Stone, and Egg.  Growth would make things grow faster, the simplest example being a magical liquid fertilizer.  Stone would be a defensive element, used in creating something like a potion of stoneskin.  Egg would be interesting though.  What if instead of being imbibed there were potions that instead functioned similarly to the sourdough items, or the blob vehicle parts, in that they take a gestation period and then you could activate them and have a new item pop out.  Creatures sure but especially biomancers could have temporarily-lived tools, weapons, and armor."
