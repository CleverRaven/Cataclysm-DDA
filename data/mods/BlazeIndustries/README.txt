WARNING: THIS IS NOT COMPATIBLE NOR MIGRATION READY WITH THE OLD BLAZEMOD. If you want to use the last modernised version of the legacy blazemod,
please get it from https://github.com/Soup-de-Loop/CDDA-old-complete-blazemod
Uninstall any turrets and turretframes from your vehicles before updating to it in order to avoid segfaults, some errors might still be thrown but
it shouldn't crash. Contact me using the options at the end if you need help, and I will try to set aside some time to direct.

Welcome to the new and improved blazemod, now with 90% less content. 

Where did most of the content of blazemod go, you might be wondering? Despite having gotten the quality of the code to a modern state, most of the
content is actually quite out of place when compared to each other, and each part including the basic essentials of blazemod deserve to be worked on
separately and properly implemented into the game rather than being kept in an uneasy limbo or left to be deleted.

If you wish to restore old content that is now modernised, you can get them at the following links, but do not try to use these in conjunction with
the legacy blazemod- these are for Blaze Industries only and new weapons will become available in the new mod:

Legacy weapons:   https://github.com/Soup-de-Loop/CDDA-blaze-legacy-weapons
Blob stuff:       https://github.com/Soup-de-Loop/CDDA-blob-vehicles
Diamond & Vortex: https://github.com/Soup-de-Loop/CCDA-high-science-vehicles

If your save is older than 0.E, I recommend that you keep your older version of blazemod backed up or use the version at the start of this README
and put it back into the game files each time you update. Blaze Industries has a different ident and name to blazemod so that it's possible to
overlap and ignore the new content if you choose not to use it in lieu of the legacy stuff.
